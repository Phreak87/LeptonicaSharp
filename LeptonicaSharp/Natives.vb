''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This is a top-level interface for normalizing the image intensity
''' by mapping the image so that the background is near the input
''' value 'bgval'.
''' (2) The input image is either grayscale or rgb.
''' (3) For each component in the input image, the background value
''' in each tile is estimated using the values in the tile that
''' are not part of the foreground, where the foreground is
''' determined by the input 'thresh' argument.
''' (4) An optional binary mask can be specified, with the foreground
''' pixels typically over image regions.  The resulting background
''' map values will be determined by surrounding pixels that are
''' not under the mask foreground.  The origin (0,0) of this mask
''' is assumed to be aligned with the origin of the input image.
''' This binary mask must not fully cover pixs, because then there
''' will be no pixels in the input image available to compute
''' the background.
''' (5) An optional grayscale version of the input pixs can be supplied.
''' The only reason to do this is if the input is RGB and this
''' grayscale version can be used elsewhere.  If the input is RGB
''' and this is not supplied, it is made internally using only
''' the green component, and destroyed after use.
''' (6) The dimensions of the pixel tile (sx, sy) give the amount by
''' by which the map is reduced in size from the input image.
''' (7) The threshold is used to binarize the input image, in order to
''' locate the foreground components.  If this is set too low,
''' some actual foreground may be used to determine the maps;
''' if set too high, there may not be enough background
''' to determine the map values accurately.  Typically, it's
''' better to err by setting the threshold too high.
''' (8) A 'mincount' threshold is a minimum count of pixels in a
''' tile for which a background reading is made, in order for that
''' pixel in the map to be valid.  This number should perhaps be
''' at least 1/3 the size of the tile.
''' (9) A 'bgval' target background value for the normalized image.  This
''' should be at least 128.  If set too close to 255, some
''' clipping will occur in the result.
''' (10) Two factors, 'smoothx' and 'smoothy', are input for smoothing
''' the map.  Each low-pass filter kernel dimension is
''' is 2  (smoothing factor) + 1, so a
''' value of 0 means no smoothing. A value of 1 or 2 is recommended.

''' Notes:
''' (1) The basis of this approach is the use of seed spreading

''' The resulting dense estimates are smoothed by convolution
''' and used to either threshold the input image or normalize it

''' that the local threshold estimate becomes constant over the
''' resulting image.  This approach is one of several that
''' have been suggested (and implemented) by Ray Smith.
''' (2) You can use either the Sobel or TwoSided edge filters.
''' The results appear to be similar, using typical values
''' of edgethresh in the rang 10-20.
''' (3) To skip the trc enhancement, use gamma = 1.0, minval = 0
''' and maxval = 255.
''' (4) For the normalized image pixd, each pixel is linearly mapped
''' in such a way that the local threshold is equal to targetthresh.
''' (5) The full width and height of the convolution kernel

''' Notes:
''' (1) This function adaptively attempts to expand the contrast
''' to the full dynamic range in each tile.  If the contrast in
''' a tile is smaller than %mindiff, it uses the min and max
''' pixel values from neighboring tiles.  It also can use
''' convolution to smooth the min and max values from
''' neighboring tiles.  After all that processing, it is
''' possible that the actual pixel values in the tile are outside
''' the computed [min ... max] range for local contrast
''' normalization.  Such pixels are taken to be at either 0
''' (if below the min) or 255 (if above the max).
''' (2) pixd can be equal to pixs (in-place operation) or
''' null (makes a new pixd).
''' (3) sx and sy give the tile size; they are typically at least 20.
''' (4) mindiff is used to eliminate results for tiles where it is
''' likely that either fg or bg is missing.  A value around 50
''' or more is reasonable.
''' (5) The full width and height of the convolution kernel
''' are (2  smoothx + 1) and (2  smoothy + 1).  Some smoothing
''' is typically useful, and we limit the smoothing half-widths
''' to the range from 0 to 8.
''' (6) A linear TRC (gamma = 1.0) is applied to increase the contrast
''' in each tile.  The result can subsequently be globally corrected,
''' by applying pixGammaTRC() with arbitrary values of gamma
''' and the 0 and 255 points of the mapping.

''' Notes:
''' (1) The alpha channel is transformed separately from pixs,
''' and aligns with it, being fully transparent outside the
''' boundary of the transformed pixs.  For pixels that are fully
''' transparent, a blending function like pixBlendWithGrayMask()
''' will give zero weight to corresponding pixels in pixs.
''' (2) If pixg is NULL, it is generated as an alpha layer that is
''' partially opaque, using %fract.  Otherwise, it is cropped
''' to pixs if required and %fract is ignored.  The alpha channel
''' in pixs is never used.
''' (3) Colormaps are removed.
''' (4) When pixs is transformed, it doesn't matter what color is brought
''' in because the alpha channel will be transparent (0) there.
''' (5) To avoid losing source pixels in the destination, it may be
''' necessary to add a border to the source pix before doing
''' the affine transformation.  This can be any non-negative number.
''' (6) The input %ptad and %ptas are in a coordinate space before
''' the border is added.  Internally, we compensate for this
''' before doing the affine transform on the image after the border
''' is added.
''' (7) The default setting for the border values in the alpha channel
''' is 0 (transparent) for the outermost ring of pixels and
''' (0.5  fract  255) for the second ring.  When blended over
''' a second image, this
''' (a) shrinks the visible image to make a clean overlap edge
''' with an image below, and
''' (b) softens the edges by weakening the aliasing there.

''' un-transformed src point.  So, for example, if you transform
''' a boxa using transform A, to transform an image in the same
''' way you must use the inverse of A.
''' For example, if you transform a boxa with a 3x3 affine matrix
''' 'mat', the analogous image transformation must use 'matinv':
''' \code
''' boxad = boxaAffineTransform(boxas, mat);
''' affineInvertXform(mat, matinv);

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This performs a relatively fast, separable bilateral
''' filtering operation.  The time is proportional to ncomps
''' and varies inversely approximately as the cube of the
''' reduction factor.  See bilateral.h for algorithm details.
''' (2) We impose minimum values for range_stdev and ncomps to
''' avoid nasty artifacts when either are too small.  We also
''' impose a constraint on their product:
''' ncomps  range_stdev  bigger = 100.
''' So for values of range_stdev  bigger = 25, ncomps can be as small as 4.
''' Here is a qualitative, intuitive explanation for this constraint.
''' Call the difference in k values between the J(k) == 'delta', where
''' 'delta' ~ 200 / ncomps
''' Then this constraint is roughly equivalent to the condition:
''' 'delta'  smaller  2  range_stdev
''' Note that at an intensity difference of (2  range_stdev), the
''' range part of the kernel reduces the effect by the factor 0.14.
''' This constraint requires that we have a sufficient number of
''' PCBs (i.e, a small enough 'delta'), so that for any value of
''' image intensity I, there exists a k (and a PCB, J(k), such that
''' |I - k|  smaller  range_stdev
''' Any fewer PCBs and we don't have enough to support this condition.
''' (3) The upper limit of 30 on ncomps is imposed because the
''' gain in accuracy is not worth the extra computation.
''' (4) The size of the gaussian kernel is twice the spatial_stdev
''' on each side of the origin.  The minimum value of
''' spatial_stdev, 0.5, is required to have a finite sized
''' spatial kernel.  In practice, a much larger value is used.
''' (5) Computation of the intermediate images goes inversely
''' as the cube of the reduction factor.  If you can use a
''' reduction of 2 or 4, it is well-advised.
''' (6) The range kernel is defined over the absolute value of pixel
''' grayscale differences, and hence must have size 256 x 1.
''' Values in the array represent the multiplying weight
''' depending on the absolute gray value difference between
''' the source pixel and the neighboring pixel, and should
''' be monotonically decreasing.
''' (7) Interesting observation.  Run this on prog/fish24.jpg, with
''' range_stdev = 60, ncomps = 6, and spatial_dev = {10, 30, 50}.
''' As spatial_dev gets larger, we get the counter-intuitive

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) The alpha channel is transformed separately from pixs,
''' and aligns with it, being fully transparent outside the
''' boundary of the transformed pixs.  For pixels that are fully
''' transparent, a blending function like pixBlendWithGrayMask()
''' will give zero weight to corresponding pixels in pixs.
''' (2) If pixg is NULL, it is generated as an alpha layer that is
''' partially opaque, using %fract.  Otherwise, it is cropped
''' to pixs if required and %fract is ignored.  The alpha channel
''' in pixs is never used.
''' (3) Colormaps are removed.
''' (4) When pixs is transformed, it doesn't matter what color is brought
''' in because the alpha channel will be transparent (0) there.
''' (5) To avoid losing source pixels in the destination, it may be
''' necessary to add a border to the source pix before doing
''' the bilinear transformation.  This can be any non-negative number.
''' (6) The input %ptad and %ptas are in a coordinate space before
''' the border is added.  Internally, we compensate for this
''' before doing the bilinear transform on the image after
''' the border is added.
''' (7) The default setting for the border values in the alpha channel
''' is 0 (transparent) for the outermost ring of pixels and
''' (0.5  fract  255) for the second ring.  When blended over
''' a second image, this
''' (a) shrinks the visible image to make a clean overlap edge
''' with an image below, and
''' (b) softens the edges by weakening the aliasing there.
''' Use l_setAlphaMaskBorder() to change these values.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) The Otsu method finds a single global threshold for an image.
''' This function allows a locally adapted threshold to be
''' found for each tile into which the image is broken up.
''' (2) The array of threshold values, one for each tile, constitutes
''' a highly downscaled image.  This array is optionally
''' smoothed using a convolution.  The full width and height of the
''' convolution kernel are (2  %smoothx + 1) and (2  %smoothy + 1).
''' (3) The minimum tile dimension allowed is 16.  If such small
''' tiles are used, it is recommended to use smoothing, because
''' without smoothing, each small tile determines the splitting
''' threshold independently.  A tile that is entirely in the
''' image bg will then hallucinate fg, resulting in a very noisy
''' binarization.  The smoothing should be large enough that no
''' tile is only influenced by one type (fg or bg) of pixels,
''' because it will force a split of its pixels.
''' (4) To get a single global threshold for the entire image, use
''' input values of %sx and %sy that are larger than the image.
''' For this situation, the smoothing parameters are ignored.
''' (5) The threshold values partition the image pixels into two classes:
''' one whose values are less than the threshold and another
''' whose values are greater than or equal to the threshold.
''' This is the same use of 'threshold' as in pixThresholdToBinary().
''' (6) The scorefract is the fraction of the maximum Otsu score, which
''' is used to determine the range over which the histogram minimum
''' is searched.  See numaSplitDistribution() for details on the
''' underlying method of choosing a threshold.
''' (7) This uses enables a modified version of the Otsu criterion for
''' splitting the distribution of pixels in each tile into a
''' fg and bg part.  The modification consists of searching for
''' a minimum in the histogram over a range of pixel values where
''' the Otsu score is within a defined fraction, %scorefract,
''' of the max score.  To get the original Otsu algorithm, set
''' %scorefract == 0.
''' (8) N.B. This method is NOT recommended for images with weak text
''' and significant background noise, such as bleedthrough, because
''' of the problem noted in (3) above for tiling.  Use Sauvola.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This finds a global threshold based on connected components.
''' Although slow, it is reasonable to use it in a situation where
''' (a) the background in the image is relatively uniform, and
''' (b) the result will be fed to an OCR program that accepts 1 bpp
''' images and works best with easily segmented characters.
''' The reason for (b) is that this selects a threshold with a
''' minimum number of both broken characters and merged characters.
''' (2) If the pix has color, it is converted to gray using the
''' max component.
''' (3) Input 0 to use default values for any of these inputs:
''' %start, %end, %incr, %thresh48, %threshdiff.
''' (4) This approach can be understood as follows.  When the
''' binarization threshold is varied, the numbers of c.c. identify
''' four regimes:
''' (a) For low thresholds, text is broken into small pieces, and
''' the number of c.c. is large, with the 4 c.c. significantly
''' exceeding the 8 c.c.
''' (b) As the threshold rises toward the optimum value, the text
''' characters coalesce and there is very little difference
''' between the numbers of 4 and 8 c.c, which both go
''' through a minimum.
''' (c) Above this, the image background gets noisy because some
''' pixels are(thresholded to foreground, and the numbers
''' of c.c. quickly increase, with the 4 c.c. significantly
''' larger than the 8 c.c.
''' (d) At even higher thresholds, the image background noise
''' coalesces as it becomes mostly foreground, and the
''' number of c.c. drops quickly.
''' (5) If there is no global threshold that distinguishes foreground
''' text from background (e.g., weak text over a background that
''' has significant variation and/or bleedthrough), this returns 1,
''' which the caller should check.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This allows a sequence of linear transforms, composed of
''' shift, scaling and rotation, where the order of the
''' transforms is specified.
''' (2) The rotation is taken about a point specified by (xcen, ycen).
''' Let the components of the vector from the center of rotation
''' to the box center be (xdif, ydif):
''' xdif = (bx + 0.5  bw) - xcen
''' ydif = (by + 0.5  bh) - ycen
''' Then the box center after rotation has new components:
''' bxcen = xcen + xdif  cosa + ydif  sina
''' bycen = ycen + ydif  cosa - xdif  sina
''' where cosa and sina are the cos and sin of the angle,
''' and the enclosing box for the rotated box has size:
''' rw = |bw  cosa| + |bh  sina|
''' rh = |bh  cosa| + |bw  sina|
''' where bw and bh are the unrotated width and height.
''' Then the box UL corner (rx, ry) is
''' rx = bxcen - 0.5  rw
''' ry = bycen - 0.5  rh
''' (3) The center of rotation specified by args %xcen and %ycen
''' is the point BEFORE any translation or scaling.  If the
''' rotation is not the first operation, this function finds
''' the actual center at the time of rotation.  It does this
''' by making the following assumptions:
''' (1) Any scaling is with respect to the UL corner, so
''' that the center location scales accordingly.
''' (2) A translation does not affect the center of
''' the image; it just moves the boxes.
''' We always use assumption (1).  However, assumption (2)
''' will be incorrect if the apparent translation is due
''' to a clipping operation that, in effect, moves the
''' origin of the image.  In that case, you should NOT use
''' these simple functions.  Instead, use the functions
''' in affinecompose.c, where the rotation center can be
''' computed from the actual clipping due to translation
''' of the image origin.

''' Notes:
''' (1) This generates a boxa of rectangles that covers
''' the fg of a mask.  It does so by a greedy partitioning of
''' the mask, choosing the largest rectangle found from
''' each of the four directions at each step.
''' (2) The input parameters give some flexibility for boundary
''' noise.  The resulting set of rectangles must cover all
''' the fg pixels and, in addition, may cover some bg pixels.
''' Using small input parameters on a noiseless mask (i.e., one
''' that has only large vertical and horizontal edges) will
''' result in a proper covering of only the fg pixels of the mask.
''' (3) The input is assumed to be a single connected component, that
''' may have holes.  From each side, sweep inward, counting
''' the pixels.  If the count becomes greater than %minsum,
''' and we have moved forward a further amount %skipdist,
''' record that count ('countref'), but don't accept if the scan
''' contains more than %maxbg bg pixels.  Continue the scan
''' until we reach a count that differs from countref by at
''' least %delta, at which point the propagation stops.  The box
''' swept out gets a score, which is the sum of fg pixels
''' minus a penalty.  The penalty is the number of bg pixels
''' in the box.  This is done from all four sides, and the
''' side with the largest score is saved as a rectangle.
''' The process repeats until there is either no rectangle
''' left, or there is one that can't be captured from any
''' direction.  For the latter case, we simply accept the
''' last rectangle.
''' (4) The input box is only used to specify the location of
''' the UL corner of pix, with respect to an origin that
''' typically represents the UL corner of an underlying image,
''' of which pix is one component.  If %box is null,
''' the UL corner is taken to be (0, 0).
''' (5) The parameter %maxcomps gives the maximum number of allowed
''' rectangles extracted from any single connected component.
''' Use 0 if no limit is to be applied.
''' (6) The flag %remainder specifies whether we take a final bounding
''' box for anything left after the maximum number of allowed
''' rectangle is extracted.
''' (7) So if %maxcomps  bigger  0, it specifies that we want no more than
''' the first %maxcomps rectangles that satisfy the input
''' criteria.  After this, we can get a final rectangle that
''' bounds everything left over by setting %remainder == 1.
''' If %remainder == 0, we only get rectangles that satisfy
''' the input criteria.
''' (8) It should be noted that the removal of rectangles can
''' break the original c.c. into several c.c.
''' (9) Summing up:
''' If %maxcomp == 0, the splitting proceeds as far as possible.
''' If %maxcomp  bigger  0, the splitting stops when %maxcomps are
''' found, or earlier if no more components can be selected.
''' If %remainder == 1 and components remain that cannot be
''' selected, they are returned as a single final rectangle;

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This takes two input boxa (boxas, boxam) and constructs boxad,
''' where each box in boxad is generated from the corresponding
''' boxes in boxas and boxam.  The rule for constructing each
''' output box depends on %subflag and %maxdiff.  Let boxs be
''' a box from %boxas and boxm be a box from %boxam.
''' If %subflag == L_USE_MINSIZE: the output box is the intersection
''' of the two input boxes.
''' If %subflag == L_USE_MAXSIZE: the output box is the union of the
''' two input boxes; i.e., the minimum bounding rectangle for the
''' two input boxes.
''' If %subflag == L_SUB_ON_LOC_DIFF: each side of the output box
''' is found separately from the corresponding side of boxs and boxm.
''' Use the boxm side, expanded by %extrapixels, if greater than
''' %maxdiff pixels from the boxs side.
''' If %subflag == L_SUB_ON_SIZE_DIFF: the sides of the output box
''' are determined in pairs from the width and height of boxs
''' and boxm.  If the boxm width differs by more than %maxdiff
''' pixels from boxs, use the boxm left and right sides,
''' expanded by %extrapixels.  Ditto for the height difference.
''' For the last two flags, each side of the output box is found
''' separately from the corresponding side of boxs and boxm,
''' according to these rules, where "smaller"("bigger") mean in a
''' direction that decreases(increases) the size of the output box:
''' If %subflag == L_USE_CAPPED_MIN: use the Min of boxm
''' with the Max of (boxs, boxm +- %maxdiff), where the sign
''' is adjusted to make the box smaller (e.g., use "+" on left side).
''' If %subflag == L_USE_CAPPED_MAX: use the Max of boxm
''' with the Min of (boxs, boxm +- %maxdiff), where the sign
''' is adjusted to make the box bigger (e.g., use "-" on left side).
''' Use of the last 2 flags is further explained in (3) and (4).
''' (2) boxas and boxam must be the same size.  If boxam == NULL,
''' this returns a copy of boxas with a warning.
''' (3) If %subflag == L_SUB_ON_LOC_DIFF, use boxm for each side
''' where the corresponding sides differ by more than %maxdiff.
''' Two extreme cases:
''' (a) set %maxdiff == 0 to use only values from boxam in boxad.
''' (b) set %maxdiff == 10000 to ignore all values from boxam;
''' then boxad will be the same as boxas.
''' (4) If %subflag == L_USE_CAPPED_MAX: use boxm if boxs is smaller;
''' use boxs if boxs is bigger than boxm by an amount up to %maxdiff;
''' and use boxm +- %maxdiff (the 'capped' value) if boxs is
''' bigger than boxm by an amount larger than %maxdiff.
''' Similarly, with interchange of Min/Max and sign of %maxdiff,
''' for %subflag == L_USE_CAPPED_MIN.
''' (5) If either of corresponding boxes in boxas and boxam is invalid,
''' an invalid box is copied to the result.
''' (6) Typical input for boxam may be the output of boxaLinearFit().
''' where outliers have been removed and each side is LS fit to a line.
''' (7) Unlike boxaAdjustWidthToTarget() and boxaAdjustHeightToTarget(),
''' this uses two boxes and does not specify target dimensions.
''' Additional constraints on the size of each box can be enforced
''' by following this operation with boxaConstrainSize(), taking
''' boxad as input.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) The basic idea is to reconcile differences in box height
''' in the even and odd boxes, by moving the top and/or bottom
''' edges in the even and odd boxes.  Choose the edge or edges
''' to be moved, whether to adjust the boxes with the min
''' or the max of the medians, and the threshold on the median
''' difference between even and odd box heights for the operations
''' to take place.  The same threshold is also used to
''' determine if each individual box edge is to be adjusted.
''' (2) Boxes are conditionally reset with either the same top (y)
''' value or the same bottom value, or both.  The value is
''' determined by the greater or lesser of the medians of the
''' even and odd boxes, with the choice depending on the value
''' of %op, which selects for either min or max median height.
''' If the median difference between even and odd boxes is
''' greater than %dely, then any individual box edge that differs
''' from the selected median by more than %dely is set to
''' the selected median times a factor typically near 1.0.
''' (3) Note that if selecting for minimum height, you will choose
''' the largest y-value for the top and the smallest y-value for
''' the bottom of the box.
''' (4) Typical input might be the output of boxaSmoothSequence(),
''' where even and odd boxa have been independently regulated.
''' (5) Require at least 3 valid even boxes and 3 valid odd boxes.
''' Median values will be used for invalid boxes.
''' (6) If the median height is not representative of the boxes
''' in %boxas, this can make things much worse.  In that case,
''' ignore the value of %op, and force pairwise equality of the
''' heights, with pairwise maximal vertical extension.

''' (2) For the holes, use coordinates relative to the c.c.
''' (3) This is slower than Method 2.
''' (4) This uses topological properties (Method 1) to do scan
''' conversion to raster
''' This algorithm deserves some commentary.
''' I first tried the following:
''' ~ outer borders: 4-fill from outside, stopping at the
''' border, using pixFillClosedBorders()
''' ~ inner borders: 4-fill from outside, stopping again
''' at the border, XOR with the border, and invert
''' to get the hole.  This did not work, because if
''' you have a hole border that looks like:
''' x x x x x x
''' x x
''' x   x x x   x
''' x x o x   x
''' x  x
''' x  x
''' x x x
''' if you 4-fill from the outside, the pixel 'o' will
''' not be filled!  XORing with the border leaves it OFF.
''' Inverting then gives a single bad ON pixel that is not
''' actually part of the hole.
''' So what you must do instead is 4-fill the holes from inside.
''' You can do this from a seedfill, using a pix with the hole
''' border as the filling mask.  But you need to start with a
''' pixel inside the hole.  How is this determined?  The best
''' way is from the contour.  We have a right-hand shoulder
''' rule for inside (i.e., the filled region).   Take the
''' first 2 pixels of the hole border, and compute dx and dy
''' (second coord minus first coord:  dx = sx - fx, dy = sy - fy).
''' There are 8 possibilities, depending on the values of dx and
''' dy (which can each be -1, 0, and +1, but not both 0).
''' These 8 cases can be broken into 4; see the simple algorithm below.
''' Once you have an interior seed pixel, you fill from the seed,
''' clipping with the hole border pix by filling into its invert.
''' You then successively XOR these interior filled components, in any order.

''' (1) See "Connectivity-preserving morphological image transformations,"
''' Dan S. Bloomberg, in SPIE Visual Communications and Image
''' Processing, Conference 1606, pp. 320-334, November 1991,
''' Boston, MA.   A web version is available at
''' http://www.leptonica.com/papers/conn.pdf
''' (2) This is a simple interface for two of the best iterative
''' morphological thinning algorithms, for 4-c.c and 8-c.c.
''' Each iteration uses a mixture of parallel operations
''' (using several different 3x3 Sels) and serial operations.
''' Specifically, each thinning iteration consists of
''' four sequential thinnings from each of four directions.
''' Each of these thinnings is a parallel composite
''' operation, where the union of a set of HMTs are set
''' subtracted from the input.  For 4-cc thinning, we
''' use 3 HMTs in parallel, and for 8-cc thinning we use 4 HMTs.
''' (3) A "good" thinning algorithm is one that generates a skeleton
''' that is near the medial axis and has neither pruned
''' real branches nor left extra dendritic branches.
''' (4) Duality between operations on fg and bg require switching
''' the connectivity.  To thin the foreground, which is the usual
''' situation, use type == L_THIN_FG.  Thickening the foreground
''' is equivalent to thinning the background (type == L_THIN_BG),
''' where the alternate connectivity gets preserved.
''' For example, to thicken the fg with 2 rounds of iterations
''' using 4-c.c., thin the bg using Sels that preserve 8-connectivity:
''' Pix pix = pixThinConnected(pixs, L_THIN_BG, 8, 2);
''' (5) This makes and destroys the sela set each time. It's not a large
''' overhead, but if you are calling this thousands of times on
''' very small images, you can avoid the overhead; e.g.
''' Sela sela = selaMakeThinSets(1, 0);  // for 4-c.c.
''' Pix pix = pixThinConnectedBySet(pixs, L_THIN_FG, sela, 0);
''' using set 1 for 4-c.c. and set 5 for 8-c.c operations.

''' (2) The four size constraints on saved components are all
''' scaled by %reduction.
''' (3) The result are word images (and their b.b.), extracted in
''' textline order, at either full res or 2x reduction,

''' (4) The pixa and boxa interfaces should make this type of

''' ~ generate first estimate of word masks

''' ~ extract pixa of the word images, using the b.b.
''' ~ sort actual word images in textline order (2d)
''' ~ flatten them to a pixa (1d), saving the textline index
''' for each pix
''' (5) In an actual application, it may be desirable to pre-filter
''' the input image to remove large components, to extract
''' single columns of text, and to deskew them.  For example,
''' to remove both large components and small noisy components
''' that can interfere with the statistics used to estimate
''' parameters for segmenting by words, but still retain text lines,
''' the following image preprocessing can be done:
''' Pix pixt = pixMorphSequence(pixs, "c40.1", 0);
''' Pix pixf = pixSelectBySize(pixt, 0, 60, 8,
''' L_SELECT_HEIGHT, L_SELECT_IF_LT, NULL);
''' pixAnd(pixf, pixf, pixs);  // the filtered image
''' The closing turns text lines into long blobs, but does not
''' significantly increase their height.  But if there are many
''' small connected components in a dense texture, this is likely
''' to generate tall components that will be eliminated in pixf.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) For an RGB image, a gray pixel is one where all three components
''' are equal.  We define the amount of color in an RGB pixel as
''' a function depending on the absolute value of the differences
''' between the three color components.  Consider the two largest
''' of these differences.  The pixel component in common to these
''' two differences is the color farthest from the other two.
''' The color magnitude in an RGB pixel can be taken as one
''' of these three definitions:
''' (a) The average of these two differences.  This is the
''' average distance from the two components that are
''' nearest to each other to the third component.
''' (b) The minimum value of these two differences.  This is
''' the intermediate value of the three distances between
''' component values.  Stated otherwise, it is the
''' maximum over all components of the minimum distance
''' from that component to the other two components.
''' (c) The maximum difference between component values.
''' (2) As an example, suppose that R and G are the closest in
''' magnitude.  Then the color is determined as either:
''' (a) The average distance of B from these two:
''' (|B - R| + |B - G|) / 2
''' (b) The minimum distance of B from these two:
''' min(|B - R|, |B - G|).
''' (c) The maximum distance of B from these two:
''' max(|B - R|, |B - G|)
''' (3) The three methods for choosing the color magnitude from
''' the components are selected with these flags:
''' (a) L_MAX_DIFF_FROM_AVERAGE_2
''' (b) L_MAX_MIN_DIFF_FROM_2
''' (c) L_MAX_DIFF

''' Notes:
''' (1) The generated mask identifies each pixel as either color or

''' constraints:
''' (a) The max difference between the r,g and b components must
''' equal or exceed a threshold %threshdiff.
''' (b) It must be at least %mindist (in an 8-connected way)

''' (2) The distance constraint (b) is only applied if %mindist  bigger  1.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This function is asking the question: to what extent does the
''' image appear to have color?   The amount of color a pixel
''' appears to have depends on both the deviation of the
''' individual components from their average and on the average
''' intensity itself.  For example, the color will be much more
''' obvious with a small deviation from white than the same
''' deviation from black.
''' (2) Any pixel that meets these three tests is considered a
''' colorful pixel:
''' (a) the lightest component must equal or exceed %darkthresh
''' (b) the darkest component must not exceed %lightthresh
''' (c) the max difference between components must equal or
''' exceed %diffthresh.
''' (3) The dark pixels are removed from consideration because
''' they don't appear to have color.
''' (4) The very lightest pixels are removed because if an image
''' has a lot of "white", the color fraction will be artificially
''' low, even if all the other pixels are colorful.
''' (5) If pixfract is very small, there are few pixels that are neither
''' black nor white.  If colorfract is very small, the pixels
''' that are neither black nor white have very little color
''' content.  The product 'pixfract  colorfract' gives the
''' fraction of pixels with significant color content.
''' (6) One use of this function is as a preprocessing step for median

''' Notes:
''' (1) This function tries to determine if there is a significant
''' color or darker region on a scanned page image, where part
''' of the image is background that is either white or reddish.
''' This also allows extraction of regions of colored pixels that
''' have a smaller red component than blue or green components.
''' (2) If %pixm exists, pixels under its fg are combined with
''' dark pixels to make a mask of pixels not to be considered
''' as color candidates.
''' (3) There are four thresholds.
''' %lightthresh: compute the average value of each rgb pixel,
''' and make 10 buckets by value.  If the lightest bucket gray
''' value is below %lightthresh, the image is not considered
''' to have a light bg, and this returns 0.0 for %colorfract.
''' %darkthresh: ignore pixels darker than this (typ. fg text).
''' We make a 1 bpp mask of these pixels, and then dilate it to
''' remove all vestiges of fg from their vicinity.
''' %mindiff: consider pixels with either (b - r) or (g - r)
''' being at least this value, as having color.
''' %colordiff: consider pixels where the (max - min) difference
''' of the pixel components exceeds this value, as having color.
''' (4) All components of color pixels that are touching the image
''' border are removed.  Additionally, all pixels within some
''' normalized distance %edgefract from the image border can
''' be removed.  This insures that dark pixels near the edge
''' of the image are not included.
''' (5) This returns in %pcolorfract the fraction of pixels that have
''' color and are not in the set consisting of an OR between
''' %pixm and the dilated dark pixel mask.
''' (6) No masks are returned unless light color pixels are found.
''' If colorfract  bigger  0.0 and %pcolormask1 is defined, this returns
''' a 1 bpp mask with fg pixels over the color background.
''' This mask may have some holes in it.
''' (7) If colorfract  bigger  0.0 and %pcolormask2 is defined, this returns

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This function finds a measure of the number of colors that are
''' found in low-gradient regions of an image.  By its
''' magnitude relative to some threshold (not specified in
''' this function), it gives a good indication of whether
''' quantization will generate posterization.   This number
''' is larger for images with regions of slowly varying
''' intensity (if 8 bpp) or color (if rgb). Such images, if
''' quantized, may require dithering to avoid posterization,
''' and lossless compression is then expected to be poor.
''' (2) If pixs has a colormap, the number of colors returned is
''' the number in the colormap.
''' (3) It is recommended that document images be reduced to a width
''' of 800 pixels before applying this function.  Then it can
''' be expected that color detection will be fairly accurate
''' and the number of colors will reflect both the content and
''' the type of compression to be used.  For less than 15 colors,
''' there is unlikely to be a halftone image, and lossless
''' quantization should give both a good visual result and
''' better compression.
''' (4) When using the default threshold on the gradient (15),
''' images (both gray and rgb) where ncolors is greater than
''' about 15 will compress poorly with either lossless
''' compression or dithered quantization, and they may be
''' posterized with non-dithered quantization.
''' (5) For grayscale images, or images without significant color,
''' this returns the number of significant gray levels in
''' the low-gradient regions.  The actual number of gray levels
''' can be large due to jpeg compression noise in the background.
''' (6) Similarly, for color images, the actual number of different
''' (r,g,b) colors in the low-gradient regions (rather than the
''' number of occupied level 4 octcubes) can be quite large, e.g.,
''' due to jpeg compression noise, even for regions that appear
''' to be of a single color.  By quantizing to level 4 octcubes,
''' most of these superfluous colors are removed from the counting.
''' (7) The image is tested for color.  If there is very little color,
''' it is thresholded to gray and the number of gray levels in
''' the low gradient regions is found.  If the image has color,
''' the number of occupied level 4 octcubes is found.
''' (8) The number of colors in the low-gradient regions increases
''' monotonically with the threshold %thresh on the edge gradient.
''' (9) Background: grayscale and color quantization is often useful
''' to achieve highly compressed images with little visible
''' distortion.  However, gray or color washes (regions of
''' low gradient) can defeat this approach to high compression.
''' How can one determine if an image is expected to compress
''' well using gray or color quantization?  We use the fact that
''' gray washes, when quantized with less than 50 intensities,
''' have posterization (visible boundaries between regions
''' of uniform 'color') and poor lossless compression
''' color washes, when quantized with level 4 octcubes,
''' typically result in both posterization and the occupancy
''' of many level 4 octcubes.
''' Images can have colors either intrinsically or as jpeg
''' compression artifacts.  This function reduces but does not
''' completely eliminate measurement of jpeg quantization noise
''' in the white background of grayscale or color images.

''' Notes:
''' (1) This does this does a piecewise linear mapping of each
''' component of %scolor to %dcolor, based on the relation
''' between the components of %srcmap and %dstmap.  It is the
''' same transformation, performed on a single color, as mapped
''' on every pixel in a pix by pixLinearMapToTargetColor().
''' (2) For each component, if the sval is larger than the smap,
''' the dval will be pushed up from dmap towards white.
''' Otherwise, dval will be pushed down from dmap towards black.
''' This is because you can visualize the transformation as
''' a linear stretching where smap moves to dmap, and everything
''' else follows linearly with 0 and 255 fixed.
''' (3) The mapping will in general change the hue of %scolor.
''' However, if the %srcmap and %dstmap targets are related by
''' a transformation given by pixelFractionalShift(), the hue
''' will be invariant.

''' Notes:
''' (1) For each component (r, b, g) separately, this does a linear
''' mapping of the colors in pixs to colors in pixd.
''' Let rs and rd be the red src and dest components in %srcval and
''' %dstval, and rval is the red component of the src pixel.
''' Then for all pixels in pixs, the mapping for the red
''' component from pixs to pixd is:
''' if (rd  smaller = rs)   (shift toward black)
''' rval -- bigger  (rd/rs)  rval
''' if (rd  bigger  rs) (shift toward white)
''' (255 - rval) -- bigger  ((255 - rs)/(255 - rd))  (255 - rval)
''' Thus if rd  smaller = rs, the red component of all pixels is
''' mapped by the same fraction toward white, and if rd  bigger  rs,
''' they are mapped by the same fraction toward black.
''' This is essentially a different linear TRC (gamma = 1)
''' for each component.  The source and target color inputs are
''' just used to generate the three fractions.
''' (2) Note that this mapping differs from that in
''' pixLinearMapToTargetColor(), which maps rs -- bigger  rd and does
''' a piecewise stretching in between.
''' (3) For inplace operation, call it this way:
''' pixFractionalShiftByComponent(pixs, pixs, ... )
''' (4) For generating a new pixd:
''' pixd = pixLinearMapToTargetColor(NULL, pixs, ...)
''' (5) A simple application is to color a grayscale image.
''' A light background can be colored using srcval = 0xffffff00
''' and picking a target background color for dstval.
''' A dark foreground can be colored by using srcval = 0x0
''' and choosing a target foreground color for dstval.

''' <summary>
''' I found one description in the literature of octree color
''' quantization, using progressive truncation of the octree,
''' by M. Gervautz and W. Purgathofer in Graphics Gems, pp.
''' 287-293, ed. A. Glassner, Academic Press, 1990.
''' Rather than setting up a fixed partitioning of the color
''' space ab initio, as we do here, they allow the octree to be
''' progressively truncated as new pixels are added.  They
''' need to set up some data structures that are traversed
''' with the addition of each 24 bit pixel, in order to decide
''' either 1) in which cluster (sub-branch of the octree to put
''' the pixel, or 2 whether to truncate the octree further
''' to place the pixel in an existing cluster, or 3 which
''' two existing clusters should be merged so that the pixel
''' can be left to start a truncated leaf of the octree.  Such dynamic
''' truncation is considerably more complicated, and Gervautz et
''' al. did not explain how they did it in anywhere near the
''' detail required to check their implementation.
''' The simple method in pixFixedOctcubeQuant256 is very
''' fast, and with dithering the results are good, but you
''' can do better if the color clusters are selected adaptively
''' from the image.  We want a method that makes much better
''' use of color samples in regions of color space with high
''' pixel density, while also fairly representing small numbers
''' of color pixels in low density regions.  Such adaptation
''' requires two passes through the image: the first for generating
''' the pruned tree of color cubes and the second for computing the index
''' into the color table for each pixel.
''' A relatively simple adaptive method is pixOctreeQuantByPopulation.
''' That function first determines if the image has very few colors,
''' and, if so, quantizes to those colors.  If there are more than
''' 256 colors, it generates a histogram of octcube leaf occupancy
''' at level 4, chooses the 192 most populated such leaves as
''' the first 192 colors, and sets the remaining 64 colors to the
''' residual average pixel values in each of the 64 level 2 octcubes.
''' This is a bit faster than pixOctreeColorQuant, and does very
''' well without dithering, but for most images with dithering it
''' is clearly inferior.
''' We now describe pixOctreeColorQuant.  The first pass is done
''' on a subsampled image, because we do not need to use all the
''' pixels in the image to generate the tree.  Subsampling
''' down to 0.25 1/16 of the pixels makes the program run
''' about 1.3 times faster.
''' Instead of dividing the color space into 256 equal-sized
''' regions, we initially divide it into 2^12 or 2^15 or 2^18
''' equal-sized octcubes.  Suppose we choose to use 2^18 octcubes.
''' This gives us 6 octree levels.  We then prune back,
''' starting from level 6.  For every cube at level 6, there
''' are 8 cubes at level 5.  Call the operation of putting a
''' cube aside as a color table entry CTE a "saving."
''' We use a in general level-dependent threshold, and save
''' those level 6 cubes that are above threshold.
''' The rest are combined into the containing level 5 cube.
''' If between 1 and 7 level 6 cubes within a level 5
''' cube have been saved by thresholding, then the remaining
''' level 6 cubes in that level 5 cube are automatically
''' saved as well, without applying a threshold.  This greatly
''' simplifies both the description of the CTEs and the later
''' classification of each pixel as belonging to a CTE.
''' This procedure is iterated through every cube, starting at
''' level 5, and then 4, 3, and 2, successively.  The result is that
''' each CTE contains the entirety of a set of from 1 to 7 cubes
''' from a given level that all belong to a single cube at the
''' level above.   We classify the CTEs in terms of the
''' condition in which they are made as either being "threshold"
''' or "residual."  They are "threshold" CTEs if no subcubes
''' are CTEs that is, they contain every pixel within the cube
''' and the number of pixels exceeds the threshold for making
''' a CTE.  They are "residual" CTEs if at least one but not more
''' than 7 of the subcubes have already been determined to be CTEs;
''' this happens automatically -- no threshold is applied.
''' If all 8 subcubes are determined to be CTEs, the cube is
''' marked as having all pixels accounted for 'bleaf' = 1 but
''' is not saved as a CTE.
''' We stop the pruning at level 2, at which there are 64
''' sub-cubes.  Any pixels not already claimed in a CTE are
''' put in these cubes.
''' As the cubes are saved as color samples in the color table,
''' the number of remaining pixels P and the number of
''' remaining colors in the color table N are recomputed,
''' along with the average number of pixels P/N ppc to go in
''' each of the remaining colors.  This running average number is
''' used to set the threshold at the current level.
''' Because we are going to very small cubes at levels 6 or 5,
''' and will dither the colors for errors, it is not necessary
''' to compute the color center of each cluster; we can simply
''' use the center of the cube.  This gives us a minimax error
''' condition: the maximum error is half the width of the
''' level 2 cubes -- 32 color values out of 256 -- for each color
''' sample.  In practice, most of the pixels will be very much
''' closer to the center of their cells.  And with dithering,
''' the average pixel color in a small region will be closer still.
''' Thus with the octree quantizer, we are able to capture
''' regions of high color pdf probability density function in small
''' but accurate CTEs, and to have only a small number of pixels
''' that end up a significant distance with a guaranteed maximum
''' from their true color.
''' How should the threshold factor vary?  Threshold factors
''' are required for levels 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the pruning stage.
''' The threshold for level 5 is actually applied to cubes at
''' level 6, etc.  From various experiments, it appears that
''' the results do not vary appreciably for threshold values near 1.0.
''' If you want more colors in smaller cubes, the threshold
''' factors can be set lower than 1.0 for cubes at levels 4 and 5.
''' However, if the factor is set much lower than 1.0 for
''' levels 2 and 3, we can easily run out of colors.
''' We put aside 64 colors in the calculation of the threshold
''' values, because we must have 64 color centers at level 2,
''' that will have very few pixels in most of them.
''' If we reduce the factor for level 5 to 0.4, this will
''' generate many level 6 CTEs, and consequently
''' many residual cells will be formed up from those leaves,
''' resulting in the possibility of running out of colors.
''' Remember, the residual CTEs are mandatory, and are formed
''' without using the threshold, regardless of the number of
''' pixels that are absorbed.
''' The implementation logically has four parts:
''' 1 accumulation into small, fixed cells
''' 2 pruning back into selected CTE cubes
''' 3 organizing the CTEs for fast search to find
''' the CTE to which any image pixel belongs
''' 4 doing a second scan to code the image pixels by CTE
''' Step 1 is straightforward; we use 2^15 cells.
''' We've already discussed how the pruning step 2 will be performed.
''' Steps 3) and (4 are related, in that the organization
''' used by step 3 determines how the search actually
''' takes place for each pixel in step 4.
''' There are many ways to do step 3.  Let's explore a few.
''' a The simplest is to order the cubes from highest occupancy
''' to lowest, and traverse the list looking for the deepest
''' match.  To make this more efficient, so that we know when
''' to stop looking, any cube that has separate CTE subcubes
''' would be marked as such, so that we know when we hit a
''' true leaf.
''' b Alternatively, we can order the cubes by highest
''' occupancy separately each level, and work upward,
''' starting at level 5, so that when we find a match we
''' know that it will be correct.
''' c Another approach would be to order the cubes by
''' "address" and use a hash table to find the cube
''' corresponding to a pixel color.  I don't know how to
''' do this with a variable length address, as each CTE
''' will have 3n bits, where n is the level.
''' d Another approach entirely is to put the CTE cubes into
''' a tree, in such a way that starting from the root, and
''' using 3 bits of address at a time, the correct branch of
''' each octree can be taken until a leaf is found.  Because
''' a given cube can be both a leaf and also have branches
''' going to sub-cubes, the search stops only when no
''' marked subcubes have addresses that match the given pixel.
''' In the tree method, we can start with a dense infrastructure,
''' and place the leaves corresponding to the N colors
''' in the tree, or we can grow from the root only those
''' branches that end directly on leaves.
''' What we do here is to take approach d, and implement the tree
''' "virtually", as a set of arrays, one array for each level
''' of the tree.   Initially we start at level 5, an array with
''' 2^15 cubes, each with 8 subcubes.  We then build nodes at
''' levels closer to the root; at level 4 there are 2^12 nodes
''' each with 8 subcubes; etc.  Using these arrays has
''' several advantages:
''' ~  We don't need to keep track of links between cubes
''' and subcubes, because we can use the canonical
''' addressing on the cell arrays directly to determine
''' which nodes are parent cubes and which are sub-cubes.
''' ~  We can prune directly on this tree
''' ~  We can navigate the pruned tree quickly to classify
''' each pixel in the image.
''' Canonical addressing guarantees that the i-th node at level k
''' has 8 subnodes given by the 8i ... 8i+7 nodes at level k+1.
''' The pruning step works as follows.  We go from the lowest
''' level up.  At each level, the threshold is found from the
''' product of a factor near 1.0 and the ratio of unmarked pixels
''' to remaining colors minus the 64.  We march through
''' the space, sequentially considering a cube and its 8 subcubes.
''' We first check those subcubes that are not already
''' marked as CTE to see if any are above threshold, and if so,
''' generate a CTE and mark them as such.
''' We then determine if any of the subcubes have been marked.
''' If so, and there are subcubes that are not marked,
''' we generate a CTE for the cube from the remaining unmarked
''' subcubes; this is mandatory and does not depend on how many
''' pixels are in the set of subcubes.  If none of the subcubes
''' are marked, we aggregate their pixels into the cube
''' containing them, but do not mark it as a CTE; that
''' will be determined when iterating through the next level up.
''' When all the pixels in a cube are accounted for in one or more
''' colors, we set the boolean 'bleaf' to true.  This is the
''' flag used to mark the cubes in the pruning step.  If a cube
''' is marked, and all 8 subcubes are marked, then it is not
''' itself given a CTE because all pixels have already been
''' accounted for.
''' Note that the pruning of the tree and labelling of the CTEs
''' step 2 accomplishes step 3 implicitly, because the marked
''' and pruned tree is ready for use in labelling each pixel
''' in step 4.  We now, for every pixel in the image, traverse
''' the tree from the root, looking for the lowest cube that is a leaf.
''' At each level we have a cube and subcube.  If we reach a subcube
''' leaf that is marked 0, we know that the color is stored in the
''' cube above, and we've found the CTE.  Otherwise, the subcube
''' leaf is marked 1.  If we're at the last level, we've reached
''' the final leaf and must use it.  Otherwise, continue the
''' process at the next level down.
''' For robustness, efficiency and high quality output, we do the following:
''' (1) Measure the color content of the image.  If there is very little
''' color, quantize in grayscale.
''' (2) For efficiency, build the octree with a subsampled image if the
''' image is larger than some threshold size.
''' (3) Reserve an extra set of colors to prevent running out of colors
''' when pruning the octree; specifically, during the assignment
''' of those level 2 cells out of the 64 that have unassigned
''' pixels.  The problem of running out is more likely to happen
''' with small images, because the estimation we use for the
''' number of pixels available is not accurate.
''' (4) In the unlikely event that we run out of colors, the dithered
''' image can be very poor.  As this would only happen with very
''' small images, and dithering is not particularly noticeable with
''' such images, turn it off.

''' Notes:
''' (1) This color quantization method works very well without
''' dithering, using octcubes at two different levels:
''' (a) the input %level, which is either 3 or 4
''' (b) level 2 (64 octcubes to cover the entire color space)
''' (2) For best results, using %level = 4 is recommended.
''' Why do we provide an option for using level 3?  Because
''' there are 512 octcubes at level 3, and for many images
''' not more than 256 are filled.  As a result, on some images
''' a very accurate quantized representation is possible using
''' %level = 3.
''' (3) This first breaks up the color space into octcubes at the
''' input %level, and computes, for each octcube, the average
''' value of the pixels that are in it.
''' (4) Then there are two possible situations:
''' (a) If there are not more than 256 populated octcubes,
''' it returns a cmapped pix with those values assigned.
''' (b) Otherwise, it selects 192 octcubes containing the largest
''' number of pixels and quantizes pixels within those octcubes
''' to their average.  Then, to handle the residual pixels
''' that are not in those 192 octcubes, it generates a
''' level 2 octree consisting of 64 octcubes, and within
''' each octcube it quantizes the residual pixels to their
''' average within each of those level 2 octcubes.
''' (5) Unpopulated level 2 octcubes are represented in the colormap
''' by their centers.  This, of course, has no effect unless
''' dithering is used for the output image.
''' (6) The depth of pixd is the minimum required to support the
''' number of colors found at %level; namely, 2, 4 or 8.
''' (7) This function works particularly well on images such as maps,
''' where there are a relatively small number of well-populated
''' colors, but due to antialiasing and compression artifacts
''' there may be a large number of different colors.  This will
''' pull out and represent accurately the highly populated colors,
''' while still making a reasonable approximation for the others.
''' (8) The highest level of octcubes allowed is 4.  Use of higher
''' levels typically results in having a small fraction of
''' pixels in the most populated 192 octcubes.  As a result,
''' most of the pixels are represented at level 2, which is
''' not sufficiently accurate.
''' (9) Dithering shows artifacts on some images.  If you plan to
''' dither, pixOctreeColorQuant() and pixFixedOctcubeQuant256()
''' usually give better results.

''' <summary>
''' pixOctreeColorQuant is very flexible in terms of the relative
''' depth of different cubes of the octree.   By contrast, this function,
''' pixOctreeQuantNumColors is also adaptive, but it supports octcube
''' leaves at only two depths: a smaller depth that guarantees
''' full coverage of the color space and octcubes at one level
''' deeper for more accurate colors.  Its main virutes are simplicity
''' and speed, which are both derived from the natural indexing of
''' the octcubes from the RGB values.
''' Before describing pixOctreeQuantNumColors, consider an even simpler
''' approach for 4 bpp with either 8 or 16 colors.  With 8 colors,
''' you simply go to level 1 octcubes and use the average color
''' found in each cube.  For 16 colors, you find which of the three
''' colors has the largest variance at the second level, and use two
''' indices for that color.  The result is quite poor, because 1 some
''' of the cubes are nearly empty and 2 you don't get much color
''' differentiation for the extra 8 colors.  Trust me, this method may
''' be simple, but it isn't worth anything.
''' In pixOctreeQuantNumColors, we generate colormapped images at
''' either 4 bpp or 8 bpp.  For 4 bpp, we have a minimum of 8 colors
''' for the level 1 octcubes, plus up to 8 additional colors that
''' are determined from the level 2 popularity.  If the number of colors
''' is between 8 and 16, the output is a 4 bpp image.  If the number of
''' colors is greater than 16, the output is a 8 bpp image.
''' We use a priority queue, implemented with a heap, to select the
''' requisite number of most populated octcubes at the deepest level
''' level 2 for 64 or fewer colors; level 3 for more than 64 colors.
''' These are combined with one color for each octcube one level above,
''' which is used to span the color space of octcubes that were not
''' included at the deeper level.
''' If the deepest level is 2, we combine the popular level 2 octcubes
''' out of a total of 64 with the 8 level 1 octcubes.  If the deepest
''' level is 3, we combine the popular level 3 octcubes out of a
''' total 512 with the 64 level 2 octcubes that span the color space.
''' In the latter case, we require a minimum of 64 colors for the level 2
''' octcubes, plus up to 192 additional colors determined from level 3
''' popularity.
''' The parameter 'maxlevel' is the deepest octcube level that is used.
''' The implementation also uses two LUTs, which are employed in
''' two successive traversals of the dest image.  The first maps
''' from the src octindex at 'maxlevel' to the color table index,
''' which is the value that is stored in the 4 or 8 bpp dest pixel.
''' The second LUT maps from that colormap value in the dest to a
''' new colormap value for a minimum sized colormap, stored back in
''' the dest.  It is used to remove any color map entries that
''' correspond to color space regions that have no pixels in the
''' source image.  These regions can be either from the higher level
''' e.g., level 1 for 4 bpp, or from octcubes at 'maxlevel' that
''' are unoccupied.  This remapping results in the minimum number
''' of colors used according to the constraints induced by the
''' input 'maxcolors'.  We also compute the average R, G and B color
''' values in each region of the color space represented by a
''' colormap entry, and store them in the colormap.
''' The maximum number of colors is input, which determines the
''' following properties of the dest image and octcube regions used:
''' Number of colors   dest image depth   maxlevel
''' ----------------   ----------------   --------
''' 8 to 16   4 bpp   2
''' 17 to 64  8 bpp   2
''' 65 to 256 8 bpp   3
''' It may turn out that the number of extra colors, beyond the
''' minimum 8 and 64 for maxlevel 2 and 3, respectively, is larger
''' than the actual number of occupied cubes at these levels
''' In that case, all the pixels are contained in this
''' subset of cubes at maxlevel, and no colormap colors are needed
''' to represent the remainder pixels one level above.  Thus, for
''' example, in use one often finds that the pixels in an image
''' occupy less than 192 octcubes at level 3, so they can be represented
''' by a colormap for octcubes at level 3 only.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' This simple 1-pass color quantization works by breaking the
''' color space into 256 pieces, with 3 bits quantized for each of
''' red and green, and 2 bits quantized for blue.  We shortchange
''' blue because the eye is least sensitive to blue.  This
''' division of the color space is into two levels of octrees,
''' followed by a further division by 4 not 8, where both
''' blue octrees have been combined in the third level.
''' The color map is generated from the 256 color centers by
''' taking the representative color to be the center of the
''' cell volume.  This gives a maximum error in the red and
''' green values of 16 levels, and a maximum error in the
''' blue sample of 32 levels.
''' Each pixel in the 24-bit color image is placed in its containing
''' cell, given by the relevant MSbits of the red, green and blue
''' samples.  An error-diffusion dithering is performed on each
''' color sample to give the appearance of good average local color.
''' Dithering is required; without it, the contouring and visible
''' color errors are very bad.
''' I originally implemented this algorithm in two passes,
''' where the first pass was used to compute the weighted average
''' of each sample in each pre-allocated region of color space.
''' The idea was to use these centroids in the dithering algorithm
''' of the second pass, to reduce the average error that was
''' being dithered.  However, with dithering, there is
''' virtually no difference, so there is no reason to make the
''' first pass.  Consequently, this 1-pass version just assigns
''' the pixels to the centers of the pre-allocated cells.
''' We use dithering to spread the difference between the sample
''' value and the location of the center of the cell.  For speed
''' and simplicity, we use integer dithering and propagate only
''' to the right, down, and diagonally down-right, with ratios
''' 3/8, 3/8 and 1/4, respectively.  The results should be nearly
''' as good, and a bit faster, with propagation only to the right
''' and down.
''' The algorithm is very fast, because there is no search,
''' only fast generation of the cell index for each pixel.
''' We use a simple mapping from the three 8 bit rgb samples
''' to the 8 bit cell index; namely, r7 r6 r5 g7 g6 g5 b7 b6.
''' This is not in an octcube format, but it doesn't matter.
''' There are no storage requirements.  We could keep a
''' running average of the center of each sample in each
''' cluster, rather than using the center of the cell, but
''' this is just extra work, esp. with dithering.
''' This method gives surprisingly good results with dithering.
''' However, without dithering, the loss of color accuracy is
''' evident in regions that are very light or that have subtle
''' blending of colors.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) In typical use, we are doing an operation, such as
''' interpolative scaling, on a colormapped pix, where it is
''' necessary to remove the colormap before the operation.
''' We then want to re-quantize the RGB result using the same
''' colormap.
''' (2) The level is used to divide the color space into octcubes.
''' Each input pixel is, in effect, placed at the center of an
''' octcube at the given level, and it is mapped into the
''' exact color (given in the colormap) that is the closest
''' to that location.  We need to know that distance, for each color
''' in the colormap.  The higher the level of the octtree, the smaller
''' the octcubes in the color space, and hence the more accurately
''' we can determine the closest color in the colormap; however,
''' the size of the LUT, which is the total number of octcubes,
''' increases by a factor of 8 for each increase of 1 level.
''' The time required to acquire a level 4 mapping table, which has
''' about 4K entries, is less than 1 msec, so that is the
''' recommended minimum size to be used.  At that size, the
''' octcubes have their centers 16 units apart in each (r,g,b)
''' direction.  If two colors are in the same octcube, the one
''' closest to the center will always be chosen.  The maximum
''' error for any component occurs when the correct color is
''' at a cube corner and there is an incorrect color just inside
''' the cube next to the opposite corner, giving an error of
''' 14 units (out of 256) for each component.   Using a level 5
''' mapping table reduces the maximum error to 6 units.
''' (3) Typically you should use the Euclidean metric, because the
''' resulting voronoi cells (which are generated using the actual
''' colormap values as seeds) are convex for Euclidean distance
''' but not for Manhattan distance.  In terms of the octcubes,
''' convexity of the voronoi cells means that if the 8 corners
''' of any cube (of which the octcubes are special cases)
''' are all within a cell, then every point in the cube will
''' lie within the cell.
''' (4) The depth of the output pixd is equal to the maximum of
''' (a) %mindepth and (b) the minimum (2, 4 or 8 bpp) necessary
''' to hold the indices in the colormap.
''' (5) We build a mapping table from octcube to colormap index so
''' that this function can run in a time (otherwise) independent
''' of the number of colors in the colormap.  This avoids a
''' brute-force search for the closest colormap color to each
''' pixel in the image.
''' (6) This is similar to the function pixAssignToNearestColor()
''' used for color segmentation.
''' (7) Except for very small images or when using level  bigger  4,
''' it takes very little time to generate the tables,
''' compared to the generation of the colormapped dest pix,
''' so one would not typically use the low-level version.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This function is used to quickly find the colormap color
''' that is closest to any rgb color.  It is used to assign
''' rgb colors to an existing colormap.  It can be very expensive
''' to search through the entire colormap for the closest color
''' to each pixel.  Instead, we first set up this table, which is
''' populated by the colormap index nearest to each octcube
''' color.  Then we go through the image; for each pixel,
''' do two table lookups: first to generate the octcube index
''' from rgb and second to use this table to read out the
''' colormap index.
''' (2) Do a slight modification for white and black.  For level = 4,
''' each octcube size is 16.  The center of the whitest octcube
''' is at (248, 248, 248), which is closer to 242 than 255.
''' Consequently, any gray color between 242 and 254 will
''' be selected, even if white (255, 255, 255) exists.  This is
''' typically not optimal, because the original color was
''' likely white.  Therefore, if white exists in the colormap,
''' use it for any rgb color that falls into the most white octcube.
''' Do the similar thing for black.
''' (3) Here are the actual function calls for quantizing to a
''' specified colormap:
''' ~ first make the tables that map from rgb -- bigger  octcube index
''' makeRGBToIndexTables()
''' ~ then for each pixel:
''' use the tables to get the octcube index
''' getOctcubeIndexFromRGB()
''' use this table to get the nearest color in the colormap
''' cmap_index = tab[index]
''' (4) Distance can be either manhattan or euclidean.
''' (5) In typical use, level = 4 gives reasonable results, and
''' level = 5 is slightly better.  When this function is used
''' for color segmentation, there are typically a small number
''' of colors and the number of levels can be small (e.g., level = 3).

''' (a) Preprocess the image, setting all pixels with little color
''' to black, and populating an auxiliary 8 bpp image with the
''' expected colormap values corresponding to the set of
''' quantized gray values.
''' (b) Color quantize the altered input image to n + 1 colors.
''' (c) Augment the colormap with the gray indices, and

''' (3) Median cut color quantization is relatively poor for grayscale

''' Thus, for images with both gray and color, it is important
''' to quantize the gray pixels by another method.  Here, we
''' are conservative in detecting color, preferring to use
''' a few extra bits to encode colorful pixels that push them
''' to gray.  This is particularly reasonable with this function,
''' because it handles the gray and color pixels separately,
''' using median cut color quantization for the color pixels
''' and equal-bin grayscale quantization for the non-color pixels.

''' Notes:
''' (1) This is the "few colors" version of pixMedianCutQuantMixed().
''' It fails (returns NULL) if it finds more than maxncolors, but

''' (2) Recommended input parameters are:
''' %maxncolors:  20
''' %darkthresh:  20
''' %lightthresh: 244
''' %diffthresh:  15  (any higher can miss colors differing
''' slightly from gray)
''' (3) Both ncolor and ngray should be at least equal to maxncolors.

''' (4) If very little color content is found, the input is

''' (5) This can be useful for quantizing orthographically generated

''' <summary>
''' Color segmentation proceeds in four phases:
''' Phase 1:  pixColorSegmentCluster()
''' The image is traversed in raster order.  Each pixel either
''' becomes the representative for a new cluster or is assigned to an
''' existing cluster.  Assignment is greedy.  The data is stored in
''' a colormapped image.  Three auxiliary arrays are used to hold
''' the colors of the representative pixels, for fast lookup.
''' The average color in each cluster is computed.
''' Phase 2.  pixAssignToNearestColor()
''' A second non-greedy clustering pass is performed, where each pixel
''' is assigned to the nearest cluster average.  We also keep track
''' of how many pixels are assigned to each cluster.
''' Phase 3.  pixColorSegmentClean()
''' For each cluster, starting with the largest, do a morphological
''' closing to eliminate small components within larger ones.
''' Phase 4.  pixColorSegmentRemoveColors()
''' Eliminate all colors except the most populated 'finalcolors'.
''' Then remove unused colors from the colormap, and reassign those
''' pixels to the nearest remaining cluster, using the original pixel values.
''' Notes:
''' (1) The goal is to generate a small number of colors.
''' Typically this would be specified by 'finalcolors',
''' a number that would be somewhere between 3 and 6.
''' The parameter 'maxcolors' specifies the maximum number of
''' colors generated in the first phase.  This should be
''' larger than finalcolors, perhaps twice as large.
''' If more than 'maxcolors' are generated in the first phase
''' using the input 'maxdist', the distance is repeatedly
''' increased by a multiplicative factor until the condition
''' is satisfied.  The implicit relation between 'maxdist'
''' and 'maxcolors' is thus adjusted programmatically.
''' (2) As a very rough guideline, given a target value of 'finalcolors',
''' here are approximate values of 'maxdist' and 'maxcolors'
''' to start with:
''' finalcolors maxcolors maxdist
''' ----------- --------- -------
''' 3 6 100
''' 4 8  90
''' 5   10  75
''' 6   12  60
''' For a given number of finalcolors, if you use too many
''' maxcolors, the result will be noisy.  If you use too few,
''' the result will be a relatively poor assignment of colors.

''' (2) This is an in-place operation.
''' (3) The colormap in pixd is unchanged.
''' (4) pixs and pixd must be the same size (w, h).
''' (5) The selection mask pixm can be null.  If it exists, it must

''' NULL if all pixels in pixd are to be assigned.
''' (6) The countarray can be null.  If it exists, it is pre-allocated
''' and of a size at least equal to the size of the colormap in pixd.
''' (7) This does a best-fit (non-greedy) assignment of pixels to
''' existing clusters.  Specifically, it assigns each pixel
''' in pixd to the color index in the pixd colormap that has a
''' color closest to the corresponding rgb pixel in pixs.
''' (8) 'level' is the octcube level used to quickly find the nearest
''' color in the colormap for each pixel.  For color segmentation,
''' this parameter is set to LEVEL_IN_OCTCUBE.
''' (9) We build a mapping table from octcube to colormap index so
''' that this function can run in a time (otherwise) independent

''' Notes:
''' (1) This takes 2 pix that are the same size and determines using

''' %mindiff establishes a criterion of pixel-to-pixel similarity:
''' two pixels are not similar if their difference in value is
''' at least mindiff.  Then %maxfract and %maxave are thresholds
''' on the number and distribution of dissimilar pixels
''' allowed for the two pix to be similar.   If the pix are
''' to be similar, neither threshold can be exceeded.
''' (2) In setting the %maxfract and %maxave thresholds, you have
''' these options:
''' (a) Base the comparison only on %maxfract.  Then set
''' %maxave = 0.0 or 256.0.  (If 0, we always ignore it.)
''' (b) Base the comparison only on %maxave.  Then set
''' %maxfract = 1.0.
''' (c) Base the comparison on both thresholds.
''' (3) Example of values that can be expected at mindiff = 15 when
''' comparing lossless png encoding with jpeg encoding, q=75:
''' (smoothish bg) fractdiff = 0.01, avediff = 2.5
''' (natural scene)   fractdiff = 0.13, avediff = 3.5
''' To identify these images as 'similar', select maxfract

''' (4) See pixGetDifferenceStats() for a discussion of why we subtract
''' mindiff from the computed average diff of the nonsimilar pixels
''' to get the 'avediff' returned by that function.

''' Notes:
''' (1) This takes 2 pix and determines, using 2 input parameters:
''' %dilation specifies the amount of grayscale or color
''' dilation to apply to the images, to compensate for
''' a small amount of misregistration.  A typical number might
''' be 5, which uses a 5x5 Sel.  Grayscale dilation expands
''' lighter pixels into darker pixel regions.
''' %mindiff determines the threshold on the difference in
''' pixel values to be counted -- two pixels are not similar
''' if their difference in value is at least %mindiff.  For
''' color pixels, we use the maximum component difference.
''' (2) The pixelwise comparison is always done with the UL corners
''' aligned.  The sizes of pix1 and pix2 need not be the same,
''' although in practice it can be useful to scale to the same size.
''' (3) If there is a colormap, it is removed and the result
''' is either gray or RGB depending on the colormap.
''' (4) Two optional diff images can be retrieved (typ. for debugging):
''' pixdiff1: the gray or color difference
''' pixdiff2: thresholded to 1 bpp for pixels exceeding %mindiff
''' (5) The returned value of fract can be compared to some threshold,
''' which is application dependent.
''' (6) This method is in analogy to the two-sided hausdorff transform,
''' except here it is for d  bigger  1.  For d == 1 (see pixRankHaustest()),
''' we verify that when one pix1 is dilated, it covers at least a
''' given fraction of the pixels in pix2, and v.v.; in that
''' case, the two pix are sufficiently similar.  Here, we
''' do an analogous thing: subtract the dilated pix1 from pix2 to
''' get a 1-sided hausdorff-like transform.  Then do it the
''' other way.  Take the component-wise max of the two results,
''' and threshold to get the fraction of pixels with a difference
''' below the threshold.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This function compares two grayscale photo regions.  If a
''' box is given, the region is clipped; otherwise assume
''' the entire images are photo regions.  This is done with a
''' set of (nx  ny) spatially aligned histograms, which are
''' aligned using the centroid of the inverse image.
''' (2) An initial filter gives %score = 0 if the ratio of widths
''' and heights (smallest / largest) does not exceed a
''' threshold %minratio.  This must be between 0.5 and 1.0.
''' If set at 1.0, both images must be exactly the same size.
''' A typical value for %minratio is 0.9.
''' (3) Because this function should not be used on text or
''' line graphics, which can give false positive results
''' (i.e., high scores for different images), filter the images
''' using pixGenPhotoHistos(), which returns tiled histograms
''' only if an image is not text and comparison is expected
''' to work with histograms.  If either image fails the test,
''' the comparison returns a score of 0.0.
''' (4) The white value counts in the histograms are removed; they
''' are typically pixels that were padded to achieve alignment.
''' (5) For an efficient representation of the histogram, normalize
''' using a multiplicative factor so that the number in the
''' maximum bucket is 255.  It then takes 256 bytes to store.
''' (6) When comparing the histograms of two regions, use the
''' Earth Mover distance (EMD), with the histograms normalized
''' so that the sum over bins is the same.  Further normalize
''' by dividing by 255, so that the result is in [0.0 ... 1.0].
''' (7) Get a similarity score S = 1.0 - k  D, where
''' k is a constant, say in the range 5-10
''' D = normalized EMD
''' and for multiple tiles, take the Min(S) to be the final score.
''' Using aligned tiles gives protection against accidental
''' similarity of the overall grayscale histograms.
''' A small number of aligned tiles works well.
''' (8) With debug on, you get a pdf that shows, for each tile,

''' (2) The lack of symmetry between the handling of the
''' first (hc + 1) lines and the last (hc) lines,
''' and similarly with the columns, is due to fact that
''' for the pixel at (x,y), the accumulator values are
''' taken at (x + wc, y + hc), (x - wc - 1, y + hc),
''' (x + wc, y - hc - 1) and (x - wc - 1, y - hc - 1).
''' (3) We compute sums, normalized as if there were no reduced
''' area at the boundary.  This under-estimates the value
''' of the boundary pixels, so we multiply them by another
''' normalization factor that is greater than 1.
''' (4) This second normalization is done first for the first

''' (5) The caller should verify that wc  smaller  w and hc  smaller  h.
''' Under those conditions, illegal reads and writes can occur.
''' (6) Implementation note: to get the same results in the interior
''' between this function and pixConvolve(), it is necessary to
''' add 0.5 for roundoff in the main loop that runs over all pixels.
''' However, if we do that and have white (255) pixels near the
''' image boundary, some overflow occurs for pixels very close
''' to the boundary.  We can't fix this by subtracting from the
''' normalized values for the boundary pixels, because this results
''' in underflow if the boundary pixels are black (0).  Empirically,
''' adding 0.25 (instead of 0.5) before truncating in the main
''' loop will not cause overflow, but this gives some
''' off-by-1-level errors in interior pixel values.  So we add
''' 0.5 for roundoff in the main loop, and for pixels within a

''' To do a convolution on an RGB image, use pixConvolveRGB().
''' (3) The parameter %outdepth determines the depth of the result.

''' If the kernel is not normalized, it may be necessary to use

''' (4) If normflag == 1, the result is normalized by scaling all

''' is very close to zero, the kernel can not be normalized and
''' the convolution will not be performed.  A warning is issued.
''' (5) The kernel values can be positive or negative, but the

''' number.  Consequently, if it goes negative, the choices are
''' to clip to 0 or take the absolute value.  We're choosing
''' to take the absolute value.  (Another possibility would be
''' to output a second unsigned image for the negative values.)
''' If you want to get a clipped result, or to keep the negative

''' (8) The function is slow, running at about 12 machine cycles for
''' each pixel-op in the convolution.  For example, with a 3 GHz

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This is the basic function that builds the horizontal and
''' vertical disparity arrays, which allow determination of the
''' src pixel in the input image corresponding to each
''' dest pixel in the dewarped image.
''' (2) Sets vsuccess = 1 if the vertical disparity array builds.
''' Always attempts to build the horizontal disparity array,
''' even if it will not be requested (useboth == 0).
''' Sets hsuccess = 1 if horizontal disparity builds.
''' (3) The method is as follows:
''' (a) Estimate the points along the centers of all the
''' long textlines.  If there are too few lines, no
''' disparity models are built.
''' (b) From the vertical deviation of the lines, estimate
''' the vertical disparity.
''' (c) From the ends of the lines, estimate the horizontal
''' disparity, assuming that the text is made of lines
''' that are close to left and right justified.
''' (d) One can also compute an additional contribution to the
''' horizontal disparity, inferred from slopes of the top
''' and bottom lines.  We do not do this.
''' (4) In more detail for the vertical disparity:
''' (a) Fit a LS quadratic to center locations along each line.
''' This smooths the curves.
''' (b) Sample each curve at a regular interval, find the y-value
''' of the mid-point on each curve, and subtract the sampled
''' curve value from this value.  This is the vertical
''' disparity at sampled points along each curve.
''' (c) Fit a LS quadratic to each set of vertically aligned
''' disparity samples.  This smooths the disparity values
''' in the vertical direction.  Then resample at the same
''' regular interval.  We now have a regular grid of smoothed
''' vertical disparity valuels.
''' (5) Once the sampled vertical disparity array is found, it can be
''' interpolated to get a full resolution vertical disparity map.
''' This can be applied directly to the src image pixels
''' to dewarp the image in the vertical direction, making
''' all textlines horizontal.  Likewise, the horizontal
''' disparity array is used to left- and right-align the
''' longest textlines.

''' (2) Specify gray color for pixels brought in from the outside:
''' 0 is black, 255 is white.  Use -1 to select pixels from the
''' boundary of the source image.
''' (3) If the models and ref models have not been validated, this
''' will do so by calling dewarpaInsertRefModels().
''' (4) This works with both stripped and full resolution page models.
''' If the full res disparity array(s) are missing, they are remade.
''' (5) The caller must handle errors that are returned because there
''' are no valid models or ref models for the page -- typically
''' by using the input pixs.
''' (6) If there is no model for %pageno, this will use the model for
''' 'refpage' and put the result in the dew for %pageno.
''' (7) This populates the full resolution disparity arrays if
''' necessary.  If x and/or y are positive, they are used,
''' in conjunction with pixs, to determine the required
''' slope-based extension of the full resolution disparity
''' arrays in each direction.  When (x,y) == (0,0), all
''' extension is to the right and down.  Nonzero values of (x,y)
''' are useful for dewarping when pixs is deliberately undercropped.
''' (8) Important: when applying disparity to a number of images,
''' after calling this function and saving the resulting pixd,
''' you should call dewarpMinimize(dew) on the dew for %pageno.
''' This will remove pixs and pixd (or their clones) stored in dew,
''' as well as the full resolution disparity arrays.  Together,

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) The fast version uses separable 1-D filters directly on
''' the input image.  The halfwidth is either 1 (full width = 3)
''' or 2 (full width = 5).
''' (2) The fract parameter is typically taken in the
''' range:  0.2  smaller  fract  smaller  0.7
''' (3) To skip horizontal sharpening, use %fracth = 0.0; ditto for %fractv
''' (4) For one dimensional filtering (as an example):
''' For %halfwidth = 1, the low-pass filter is
''' L: 1/3 1/3   1/3
''' and the high-pass filter is
''' H = I - L:   -1/3   2/3   -1/3
''' For %halfwidth = 2, the low-pass filter is
''' L: 1/5 1/5   1/5 1/5 1/5
''' and the high-pass filter is
''' H = I - L:   -1/5  -1/5   4/5  -1/5   -1/5
''' The new sharpened pixel value is found by adding some fraction
''' of the high-pass filter value (which sums to 0) to the
''' initial pixel value:
''' N = I + fract  H
''' (5) For 2D, the sharpening filter is not separable, because the
''' vertical filter depends on the horizontal location relative
''' to the filter origin, and v.v.   So we either do the full
''' 2D filter (for %halfwidth == 1) or do the low-pass
''' convolution separably and then compose with the original pix.

''' Notes:
''' (1) This allows independent fractional shifts of the r,g and b
''' components.  A positive shift pushes to saturation (255);
''' a negative shift pushes toward 0 (black).
''' (2) The effect can be imagined using a color wheel that consists
''' (for our purposes) of these 6 colors, separated by 60 degrees:
''' red, magenta, blue, cyan, green, yellow
''' (3) So, for example, a negative shift of the blue component
''' (bfract  smaller  0) could be accompanied by positive shifts
''' of red and green to make an image more yellow.

''' pp 302-316, Feb 6-7, 1995, San Jose, CA
''' (2) upconf is the normalized difference between up ascenders
''' and down ascenders.  The image is analyzed without rotation
''' for being rightside-up or upside-down.  Set upconf to null
''' to skip this operation.
''' (3) leftconf is the normalized difference between up ascenders
''' and down ascenders in the image after it has been
''' rotated 90 degrees clockwise.  With that rotation, ascenders
''' projecting to the left in the source image will project up
''' in the rotated image.  We compute this by rotating 90 degrees
''' clockwise and testing for up and down ascenders.  Set
''' leftconf to null to skip this operation.
''' (4) Note that upconf and leftconf are not linear measures of
''' confidence, e.g., in a range between 0 and 100.  They
''' measure how far you are out on the tail of a (presumably)
''' normal distribution.  For example, a confidence of 10 means
''' that it is nearly certain that the difference did not
''' happen at random.  However, these values must be interpreted
''' cautiously, taking into consideration the estimated prior
''' for a particular orientation or mirror flip.   The up-down
''' signal is very strong if applied to text with ascenders
''' up and down, and relatively weak for text at 90 degrees,
''' but even at 90 degrees, the difference can look significant.
''' For example, suppose the ascenders are oriented horizontally,
''' but the test is done vertically.  Then upconf can
''' be  smaller  -MIN_CONF_FOR_UP_DOWN, suggesting the text may be
''' upside-down.  However, if instead the test were done
''' horizontally, leftconf will be very much larger
''' (in absolute value), giving the correct orientation.
''' (5) If you compute both upconf and leftconf, and there is
''' sufficient signal, the following table determines the
''' cw angle necessary to rotate pixs so that the text is
''' rightside-up:
''' 0 deg :  upconf  bigger  bigger  1, abs(upconf)  bigger  bigger  abs(leftconf)
''' 90 deg : leftconf  bigger  bigger  1,  abs(leftconf)  bigger  bigger  abs(upconf)
''' 180 deg :   upconf  smaller  smaller  -1,   abs(upconf)  bigger  bigger  abs(leftconf)
''' 270 deg :   leftconf  smaller  smaller  -1, abs(leftconf)  bigger  bigger  abs(upconf)
''' (6) One should probably not interpret the direction unless
''' there are a sufficient number of counts for both orientations,
''' in which case neither upconf nor leftconf will be 0.0.
''' (7) Uses rasterop implementation of HMT.

''' (4) We want to count the number of instances found using the HMT.

''' Notes:
''' (1) For this test, it is necessary that the text is horizontally
''' oriented, with ascenders going up.
''' (2) conf is the normalized difference between the number of
''' right and left facing characters with ascenders.
''' Left-facing are {d}; right-facing are {b, h, k}.
''' At least that was the expectation.  In practice, we can
''' really just say that it is the normalized difference in
''' hits using two specific hit-miss filters, textsel1 and textsel2,
''' after the image has been suitably pre-filtered so that
''' these filters are effective.  See (4) for what's really happening.
''' (3) A large positive conf value indicates normal text, whereas
''' a large negative conf value means the page is mirror reversed.
''' (4) The implementation is a bit tricky.  The general idea is
''' to fill the x-height part of characters, but not the space
''' between them, before doing the HMT.  This is done by
''' finding pixels added using two different operations -- a
''' horizontal close and a vertical dilation -- and adding
''' the intersection of these sets to the original.  It turns
''' out that the original intuition about the signal was largely
''' in error: much of the signal for right-facing characters
''' comes from the lower part of common x-height characters, like
''' the e and c, that remain open after these operations.
''' So it's important that the operations to close the x-height
''' parts of the characters are purposely weakened sufficiently
''' to allow these characters to remain open.  The wonders
''' of morphology!

''' (b) fpixd == fpixs  (no-op)
''' (c) fpixd != fpixs  (data copy; no change in refcount)

''' (2) The general pattern of use is:
''' fpixd = fpixCopy(fpixd, fpixs);

''' For clarity when the case is known, you can use:
''' (a) fpixd = fpixCopy(NULL, fpixs);
''' (c) fpixCopy(fpixd, fpixs);
''' (3) For case (c), we check if fpixs and fpixd are the same size.
''' If so, the data is copied directly.
''' Otherwise, the data is reallocated to the correct size
''' and the copy proceeds.  The refcount of fpixd is unchanged.

''' (c) dpixd != dpixs  (data copy; no change in refcount)
''' If the refcount of dpixd  bigger  1, case (c) will side-effect

''' (2) The general pattern of use is:
''' dpixd = dpixCopy(dpixd, dpixs);

''' For clarity when the case is known, you can use:
''' (a) dpixd = dpixCopy(NULL, dpixs);
''' (c) dpixCopy(dpixd, dpixs);
''' (3) For case (c), we check if dpixs and dpixd are the same size.
''' If so, the data is copied directly.
''' Otherwise, the data is reallocated to the correct size
''' and the copy proceeds.  The refcount of dpixd is unchanged.

''' <returns>pixd dithered binary, or NULL on error The Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion dithering algorithm binarizes an 8 bpp grayscale image to a threshold of 128. If a pixel has a value above 127, it is binarized to white and the excess below 255 is subtracted from three neighboring pixels in the fractions 3/8 to i, j+1, 3/8 to i+1, j) and 1/4 to (i+1,j+1, truncating to 0 if necessary.  Likewise, if it the pixel has a value below 128, it is binarized to black and the excess above 0 is added to the neighboring pixels, truncating to 255 if necessary. This function differs from straight dithering in that it allows clipping of grayscale to 0 or 255 if the values are sufficiently close, without distribution of the excess. This uses default values to specify the range of lower and upper values near 0 and 255, rsp that are clipped to black and white without propagating the excess. Not propagating the excess has the effect of reducing the snake patterns in parts of the image that are nearly black or white; however, it also prevents the attempt to reproduce gray for those values. The implementation is straightforward.  It uses a pair of line buffers to avoid changing pixs.  It is about the same speed as pixDitherToBinaryLUT(), which uses three LUTs.</returns>

If cmapflag == 1, the colormap values are set to 0, 85, 170 and 255. If a pixel has a value between 0 and 42, it is dibitized to 0, and the excess above 0 is added to the three neighboring pixels, in the fractions 3/8 to i, j+1, 3/8 to i+1, j) and 1/4 to (i+1, j+1, truncating to 255 if necessary.  If a pixel has a value between 43 and 127, it is dibitized to 1, and the excess above 85 is added to the three neighboring pixels as before.  If the value is below 85, the excess is subtracted.  With a value between 128 and 212, it is dibitized to 2, with the excess on either side of 170 distributed as before.  Finally, with a value between 213 and 255, it is dibitized to 3, with the excess below 255 subtracted from the neighbors.  We always truncate to 0 or 255. The details can be seen in the lookup table generation. This function differs from straight dithering in that it allows clipping of grayscale to 0 or 255 if the values are sufficiently close, without distribution of the excess.

''' Notes:
''' (1) Valid values for nlevels is the set {2, 3, 4}.
''' (2) Any colormap on the input pixs is removed to 8 bpp grayscale.
''' (3) This function is typically invoked with cmapflag == 1.
''' In the situation where no colormap is desired, nlevels is
''' ignored and pixs is thresholded to 4 levels.
''' (4) The target output colors are equally spaced, with the
''' darkest at 0 and the lightest at 255.  The thresholds are
''' chosen halfway between adjacent output values.  A table
''' is built that specifies the mapping from src to dest.
''' (5) If cmapflag == 1, a colormap of size 'nlevels' is made,
''' and the pixel values in pixs are replaced by their
''' appropriate color indices.  The number of holdouts,
''' 4 - nlevels, will be between 0 and 2.
''' (6) If you don't want the thresholding to be equally spaced,
''' either first transform the 8 bpp src using pixGammaTRC().
''' or, if cmapflag == 1, after calling this function you can use
''' pixcmapResetColor() to change any individual colors.
''' (7) If a colormap is generated, it will specify (to display
''' programs) exactly how each level is to be represented in RGB
''' space.  When representing text, 3 levels is far better than
''' 2 because of the antialiasing of the single gray level,
''' and 4 levels (black, white and 2 gray levels) is getting
''' close to the perceptual quality of a (nearly continuous)
''' grayscale image.  With 2 bpp, you can set up a colormap
''' and allocate from 2 to 4 levels to represent antialiased text.
''' Any left over colormap entries can be used for coloring regions.
''' For the same number of levels, the file size of a 2 bpp image

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) Valid values for nlevels is the set {2, ... 16}.
''' (2) Any colormap on the input pixs is removed to 8 bpp grayscale.
''' (3) This function is typically invoked with cmapflag == 1.
''' In the situation where no colormap is desired, nlevels is
''' ignored and pixs is thresholded to 16 levels.
''' (4) The target output colors are equally spaced, with the
''' darkest at 0 and the lightest at 255.  The thresholds are
''' chosen halfway between adjacent output values.  A table
''' is built that specifies the mapping from src to dest.
''' (5) If cmapflag == 1, a colormap of size 'nlevels' is made,
''' and the pixel values in pixs are replaced by their
''' appropriate color indices.  The number of holdouts,
''' 16 - nlevels, will be between 0 and 14.
''' (6) If you don't want the thresholding to be equally spaced,
''' either first transform the 8 bpp src using pixGammaTRC().
''' or, if cmapflag == 1, after calling this function you can use
''' pixcmapResetColor() to change any individual colors.
''' (7) If a colormap is generated, it will specify, to display
''' programs, exactly how each level is to be represented in RGB
''' space.  When representing text, 3 levels is far better than
''' 2 because of the antialiasing of the single gray level,
''' and 4 levels (black, white and 2 gray levels) is getting
''' close to the perceptual quality of a (nearly continuous)
''' grayscale image.  Therefore, with 4 bpp, you can set up a
''' colormap, allocate a relatively small fraction of the 16
''' possible values to represent antialiased text, and use the
''' other colormap entries for other things, such as coloring
''' text or background.  Two other reasons for using a small number
''' of gray values for antialiased text are (1) PNG compression
''' gets worse as the number of levels that are used is increased,
''' and (2) using a small number of levels will filter out most of
''' the jpeg ringing that is typically introduced near sharp edges
''' of text.  This filtering is partly responsible for the improved
''' compression.

''' (2) The output image (pixd) depth is specified by %outdepth.  The

''' outdepth = 8 nbins  smaller = 256
''' With %outdepth == 0, the minimum required depth for the
''' given number of bins is used.
''' The output pixd has a colormap.
''' (3) The last 3 args determine the specific values that go into
''' the colormap.
''' (4) For %use_average:
''' ~ if TRUE, the average value of pixels falling in the bin is
''' chosen as the representative gray value.  Otherwise,
''' ~ if FALSE, the central value of each bin is chosen as

''' The colormap holds the representative value.
''' (5) For %setblack, if TRUE the darkest color is set to (0,0,0).
''' (6) For %setwhite, if TRUE the lightest color is set to (255,255,255).
''' (7) An alternative to using this function to quantize to

''' Notes:
''' (1) This is useful for quantizing images with relatively few
''' colors, but which may have both color and gray pixels.
''' If there are color pixels, it is assumed that an input
''' rgb image has been color quantized first so that:
''' ~ pixd has a colormap describing the color pixels
''' ~ pixm is a mask over the non-color pixels in pixd
''' ~ the colormap in pixd, and the color pixels in pixd,
''' have been repacked to go from 0 to n-1 (n colors)
''' If there are no color pixels, pixd and pixm are both null,
''' and all pixels in pixs are quantized to gray.
''' (2) A 256-entry histogram is built of the gray values in pixs.
''' If pixm exists, the pixels contributing to the histogram are
''' restricted to the fg of pixm.  A colormap and LUT are generated
''' from this histogram.  We break up the array into a set
''' of intervals, each one constituting a color in the colormap:
''' An interval is identified by summing histogram bins until
''' either the sum equals or exceeds the %minfract of the total
''' number of pixels, or the span itself equals or exceeds %maxsize.
''' The color of each bin is always an average of the pixels
''' that constitute it.
''' (3) Note that we do not specify the number of gray colors in
''' the colormap.  Instead, we specify two parameters that
''' describe the accuracy of the color assignments; this and
''' the actual image determine the number of resulting colors.
''' (4) If a mask exists and it is not the same size as pixs, make
''' a new mask the same size as pixs, with the original mask
''' aligned at the UL corners.  Set all additional pixels
''' in the (larger) new mask set to 1, causing those pixels
''' in pixd to be set as gray.

''' <returns>next template number, or -1 when finished We have a dna hash table that maps template area to a list of template numbers with that area.  We wish to find similar sized templates, so we first look for templates with the same width and height, and then with width + 1, etc.  This walk is guided by the two_by_two_walk array, above. We don't want to have to collect the whole list of templates first, because we hope to find a well-matching template quickly.  So we keep the context for this walk in an explictit state structure, and this function acts like a generator.</returns>

''' dilation will be between 3 and 10.
''' (3) A good size for dilating to get word masks is optionally returned.
''' (4) Typically, the number of c.c. reduced with each successive
''' dilation (stored in nadiff) decreases quickly to a minimum
''' (where the characters in a word are joined), and then
''' increases again as the smaller number of words are joined.
''' For the typical case, you can then look for this minimum
''' and dilate to get the word mask.  However, there are many
''' cases where the function is not so simple. For example, if the
''' pix has been upscaled 2x, the nadiff function oscillates, with
''' every other value being zero!  And for some images it tails
''' off without a clear minimum to indicate where to break.
''' So a more simple and robust method is to find the dilation

''' If a pix is generated with at least one warning of data

''' Notes:
''' (1) Progressive encoding gives better compression, at the
''' expense of slower encoding and decoding.
''' (2) Standard chroma subsampling is 2x2 on both the U and V
''' channels.  For highest quality, use no subsampling; this
''' option is set by pixSetChromaSampling(pix, 0).
''' (3) The only valid pixel depths in leptonica are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
''' and 32 bpp.  However, it is possible, and in some cases desirable,
''' to write out a jpeg file using an rgb pix that has 24 bpp.
''' This can be created by appending the raster data for a 24 bpp
''' image (with proper scanline padding) directly to a 24 bpp
''' pix that was created without a data array.
''' (4) There are two compression paths in this function:
''' Grayscale image, no colormap: compress as 8 bpp image.
''' rgb full color image: copy each line into the color
''' line buffer, and compress as three 8 bpp images.
''' (5) Under the covers, the jpeg library transforms rgb to a
''' luminance-chromaticity triple, each component of which is
''' also 8 bits, and compresses that.  It uses 2 Huffman tables,
''' a higher resolution one (with more quantization levels)
''' for luminosity and a lower resolution one for the chromas.

''' (2) Commentary:
''' The goal is to find the shortest path between beginning and
''' end points, without going through walls, and there are many
''' ways to solve this problem.
''' We use a queue to implement a breadth-first search.  Two auxiliary
''' "image" data structures can be used: one to mark the visited
''' pixels and one to give the direction to the parent for each
''' visited pixel.  The first structure is used to avoid putting
''' pixels on the queue more than once, and the second is used
''' for retracing back to the origin, like the breadcrumbs in
''' Hansel and Gretel.  Each pixel taken off the queue is destroyed
''' after it is used to locate the allowed neighbors.  In fact,
''' only one distance image is required, if you initialize it
''' to some value that signifies "not yet visited."  (We use
''' a binary image for marking visited pixels because it is clearer.)
''' This method for a simple search of a binary maze is implemented in
''' pixSearchBinaryMaze().
''' An alternative method would store the (manhattan) distance
''' from the start point with each pixel on the queue.  The children
''' of each pixel get a distance one larger than the parent.  These
''' values can be stored in an auxiliary distance map image
''' that is constructed simultaneously with the search.  Once the
''' end point is reached, the distance map is used to backtrack
''' along a minimum path.  There may be several equal length
''' minimum paths, any one of which can be chosen this way.

Suppose that you can go through walls, but the cost is higher say, an increment of 3 to go into a wall pixel rather than 1?  You're still trying to find the shortest path.  One way to do this is with an ordered queue, and a simple way to visualize an ordered queue is as a set of stacks, each stack being marked with the distance of each pixel in the stack from the start.  We place the start pixel in stack 0, pop it, and process its 4 children. Each pixel is given a distance that is incremented from that of its parent 0 in this case, depending on if it is a wall pixel or not.  That value may be recorded on a distance map, according to the algorithm below.  For children of the first pixel, those not on a wall go in stack 1, and wall children go in stack 3.  Stack 0 being emptied, the process then continues with pixels being popped from stack 1. Here is the algorithm for each child pixel.  The pixel's distance value, were it to be placed on a stack, is compared with the value for it that is on the distance map.  There are three possible cases: 1 If the pixel has not yet been registered, it is pushed on its stack and the distance is written to the map. 2 If it has previously been registered with a higher distance, the distance on the map is relaxed to that of the current pixel, which is then placed on its stack. 3 If it has previously been registered with an equal or lower value, the pixel is discarded. The pixels are popped and processed successively from stack 1, and when stack 1 is empty, popping starts on stack 2. This continues until the destination pixel is popped off a stack.   The minimum path is then derived from the distance map, going back from the end point as before.  This is just Dijkstra's algorithm for a directed graph; here, the underlying graph consisting of the pixels and four edges connecting each pixel to its 4-neighbor is a special case of a directed graph, where each edge is bi-directional.  The implementation of this generalized maze search is left as an exercise to the reader. Let's generalize a bit further.  Suppose the "maze" is just a grayscale image -- think of it as an elevation map.  The cost of moving on this surface depends on the height, or the gradient, or whatever you want.  All that is required is that the cost is specified and non-negative on each link between adjacent pixels.  Now the problem becomes: find the least cost path moving on this surface between two specified end points. For example, if the cost across an edge between two pixels depends on the "gradient", you can use: cost = 1 + L_ABSdeltaV where deltaV is the difference in value between two adjacent pixels.  If the costs are all integers, we can still use an array of stacks to avoid ordering the queue e.g., by using a heap sort. This is a neat problem, because you don't even have to build a maze -- you can can use it on any grayscale image! Rather than using an array of stacks, a more practical approach is to implement with a priority queue, which is a queue that is sorted so that the elements with the largest or smallest key values always come off first.  The priority queue is efficiently implemented as a heap, and this is how we do it.  Suppose you run the algorithm using a priority queue, doing the bookkeeping with an auxiliary image data structure that saves the distance of each pixel put on the queue as before, according to the method described above.  We implement it as a 2-way choice by initializing the distance array to a large value and putting a pixel on the queue if its distance is less than the value found on the array.  When you finally pop the end pixel from the queue, you're done, and you can trace the path backward, either always going downhill or using an auxiliary image to give you the direction to go at each step.  This is implemented here in searchGrayMaze. Do we really have to use a sorted queue?  Can we solve this generalized maze with an unsorted queue of pixels?  Or even an unsorted stack, doing a depth-first search (DFS)? Consider a different algorithm for this generalized maze, where we travel again breadth first, but this time use a single, unsorted queue.  An auxiliary image is used as before to store the distances and to determine if pixels get pushed on the stack or dropped.  As before, we must allow pixels to be revisited, with relaxation of the distance if a shorter path arrives later.  As a result, we will in general have multiple instances of the same pixel on the stack with different distances.  However, because the queue is not ordered, some of these pixels will be popped when another instance with a lower distance is still on the stack.  Here, we're just popping them in the order they go on, rather than setting up a priority based on minimum distance.  Thus, unlike the priority queue, when a pixel is popped we have to check the distance map to see if a pixel with a lower distance has been put on the queue, and, if so, we discard the pixel we just popped.  So the "while" loop looks like this: ~ pop a pixel from the queue ~ check its distance against the distance stored in the distance map; if larger, discard ~ otherwise, for each of its neighbors: ~ compute its distance from the start pixel ~ compare this distance with that on the distance map: ~ if the distance map value higher, relax the distance and push the pixel on the queue ~ if the distance map value is lower, discard the pixel How does this loop terminate?  Before, with an ordered queue, it terminates when you pop the end pixel.  But with an unordered queue or stack, the first time you hit the end pixel, the distance is not guaranteed to be correct, because the pixels along the shortest path may not have yet been visited and relaxed. Because the shortest path can theoretically go anywhere, we must keep going.  How do we know when to stop?   Dijkstra uses an ordered queue to systematically remove nodes from further consideration.  Each time a pixel is popped, we're done with it; it's "finalized" in the Dijkstra sense because we know the shortest path to it.  However, with an unordered queue, the brute force answer is: stop when the queue or stack is empty, because then every pixel in the image has been assigned its minimum "distance" from the start pixel. This is similar to the situation when you use a stack for the simpler uniform-step problem: with breadth-first search BFS the pixels on the queue are automatically ordered, so you are done when you locate the end pixel as a neighbor of a popped pixel; whereas depth-first search DFS, using a stack, requires, in general, a search of every accessible pixel.  Further, if a pixel is revisited with a smaller distance, that distance is recorded and the pixel is put on the stack again. But surely, you ask, can't we stop sooner?  What if the start and end pixels are very close to each other? OK, suppose they are, and you have very high walls and a long snaking level path that is actually the minimum cost. That long path can wind back and forth across the entire maze many times before ending up at the end point, which could be just over a wall from the start.  With the unordered queue, you very quickly get a high distance for the end pixel, which will be relaxed to the minimum distance only after all the pixels of the path have been visited and placed on the queue, multiple times for many of them.  So that's the price for not ordering the queue!</returns>

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) It is more efficient to use a connectivity of 4 for the fill.
''' (2) This fills bumps to some level, and extracts the unfilled
''' part of the bump.  To extract the troughs of basins, first
''' invert pixs and then apply pixHDome().
''' (3) It is useful to compare the HDome operation with the TopHat.
''' The latter extracts peaks or valleys that have a width
''' not exceeding the size of the structuring element used
''' in the opening or closing, rsp.  The height of the peak is
''' irrelevant.  By contrast, for the HDome, the gray seedfill
''' is used to extract all peaks that have a height not exceeding
''' a given value, regardless of their width!
''' (4) Slightly more precisely, suppose you set 'height' = 40.
''' Then all bumps in pixs with a height greater than or equal
''' to 40 become, in pixd, bumps with a max value of exactly 40.
''' All shorter bumps have a max value in pixd equal to the height
''' of the bump.
''' (5) The method: the filling mask, pixs, is the image whose peaks
''' are to be extracted.  The height of a peak is the distance
''' between the top of the peak and the highest "leak" to the
''' outside -- think of a sombrero, where the leak occurs
''' at the highest point on the rim.
''' (a) Generate a seed, pixd, by subtracting some value, p, from
''' each pixel in the filling mask, pixs.  The value p is
''' the 'height' input to this function.
''' (b) Fill in pixd starting with this seed, clipping by pixs,
''' in the way described in seedfillGrayLow().  The filling
''' stops before the peaks in pixs are filled.
''' For peaks that have a height  bigger  p, pixd is filled to
''' the level equal to the (top-of-the-peak - p).
''' For peaks of height  smaller  p, the peak is left unfilled
''' from its highest saddle point (the leak to the outside).
''' (c) Subtract the filled seed (pixd) from the filling mask (pixs).
''' Note that in this procedure, everything is done starting
''' with the filling mask, pixs.
''' (6) For segmentation, the resulting image, pixd, can be thresholded
''' and used as a seed for another filling operation.

''' Notes:
''' (1) Ankur Jain suggested and implemented extending the composite
''' DWA operations beyond the 63 pixel limit.  This is a
''' simplified and approximate implementation of the extension.
''' This allows arbitrary Dwa morph operations using brick Sels,
''' by decomposing the horizontal and vertical dilations into

''' between 3 and 62.
''' (2) The 63-element dilations are exact, whereas the extra dilation
''' is approximate, because the underlying decomposition is
''' in pixDilateCompBrickDwa().  See there for further details.
''' (3) There are three cases:

''' Notes:
''' (1) The DWA implementation allows Sels to be used with hits
''' up to 31 pixels from the origin, either horizontally or
''' vertically.  Larger Sels can be used if decomposed into
''' a set of operations with Sels not exceeding 63 pixels
''' in either width or height (and with the origin as close
''' to the center of the Sel as possible).
''' (2) This returns the decomposition of a linear Sel of length
''' %size into a set of %n Sels of length 63 plus an extra
''' Sel of length %extra.
''' (3) For notation, let w == %size, n == %n, and e == %extra.
''' We have 1  smaller  e  smaller  63.
''' Then if w  smaller  64, we have n = 0 and e = w.
''' The general formula for w  bigger  63 is:
''' w = 63 + (n - 1)  62 + (e - 1)
''' Where did this come from?  Each successive convolution with
''' a Sel of length L adds a total length (L - 1) to w.
''' This accounts for using 62 for each additional Sel of size 63,
''' and using (e - 1) for the additional Sel of size e.
''' Solving for n and e for w  bigger  63:
''' n = 1 + Int((w - 63) / 62)
''' e = w - 63 - (n - 1)  62 + 1
''' The extra part is decomposed into two factors f1 and f2,
''' and the actual size of the extra part is
''' e' = f1  f2
''' Then the actual width is:

''' Notes:
''' (1) This does rasterop morphology on binary images.
''' (2) This runs a pipeline of operations; no branching is allowed.
''' (3) This only uses brick Sels, which are created on the fly.
''' In the future this will be generalized to extract Sels from
''' a Sela by name.
''' (4) A new image is always produced; the input image is not changed.
''' (5) This contains an interpreter, allowing sequences to be
''' generated and run.
''' (6) The format of the sequence string is defined below.
''' (7) In addition to morphological operations, rank order reduction
''' and replicated expansion allow operations to take place
''' downscaled by a power of 2.
''' (8) Intermediate results can optionally be displayed.
''' (9) Thanks to Dar-Shyang Lee, who had the idea for this and
''' built the first implementation.
''' (10) The sequence string is formatted as follows:
''' ~ An arbitrary number of operations,  each separated
''' by a '+' character.  White space is ignored.
''' ~ Each operation begins with a case-independent character
''' specifying the operation:
''' d or D  (dilation)
''' e or E  (erosion)
''' o or O  (opening)
''' c or C  (closing)
''' r or R  (rank binary reduction)
''' x or X  (replicative binary expansion)
''' b or B  (add a border of 0 pixels of this size)
''' ~ The args to the morphological operations are bricks of hits,
''' and are formatted as a.b, where a and b are horizontal and
''' vertical dimensions, rsp.
''' ~ The args to the reduction are a sequence of up to 4 integers,
''' each from 1 to 4.
''' ~ The arg to the expansion is a power of two, in the set
''' {2, 4, 8, 16}.
''' (11) An example valid sequence is:
''' "b32 + o1.3 + C3.1 + r23 + e2.2 + D3.2 + X4"
''' In this example, the following operation sequence is carried out:
''' b32: Add a 32 pixel border around the input image
''' o1.3: Opening with vert sel of length 3 (e.g., 1 x 3)
''' C3.1: Closing with horiz sel of length 3  (e.g., 3 x 1)
''' r23: Two successive 2x2 reductions with rank 2 in the first
''' and rank 3 in the second.  The result is a 4x reduced pix.
''' e2.2: Erosion with a 2x2 sel (origin will be at x,y: 0,0)
''' d3.2: Dilation with a 3x2 sel (origin will be at x,y: 1,0)
''' X4: 4x replicative expansion, back to original resolution
''' (12) The safe closing is used.  However, if you implement a
''' closing as separable dilations followed by separable erosions,
''' it will not be safe.  For that situation, you need to add
''' a sufficiently large border as the first operation in
''' the sequence.  This will be removed automatically at the
''' end.  There are two cautions:
''' ~ When computing what is sufficient, remember that if
''' reductions are carried out, the border is also reduced.
''' ~ The border is removed at the end, so if a border is
''' added at the beginning, the result must be at the
''' same resolution as the input!

''' (5) A new image is always produced; the input image is not changed.
''' (6) This contains an interpreter, allowing sequences to be
''' generated and run.
''' (7) Sel sizes (width, height) must each be odd numbers.
''' (8) The format of the sequence string is defined below.
''' (9) Intermediate results can optionally be displayed.
''' (10) The sequence string is formatted as follows:
''' ~ An arbitrary number of operations,  each separated
''' by a '+' character.  White space is ignored.
''' ~ Each operation begins with a case-independent character
''' specifying the operation:
''' d or D  (dilation)
''' e or E  (erosion)
''' o or O  (opening)
''' c or C  (closing)
''' ~ The args to the morphological operations are bricks of hits,
''' and are formatted as a.b, where a and b are horizontal and
''' vertical dimensions, rsp. (each must be an odd number)
''' Example valid sequences are:
''' "c5.3 + o7.5"

''' The originating Numaa owns this array: DO NOT free it!
''' (2) Intended usage:
''' Numaa naa = numaaCreate(n);
''' Numa array = numaaGetPtrArray(naa);
''' ...  [manipulate Numas directly on the array]
''' numaaDestroy(naa);
''' (3) Cautions:
''' ~ Do not free this array; it is owned by tne Numaa.
''' ~ Do not call any functions on the Numaa, other than
''' numaaDestroy() when you're finished with the array.
''' Adding a Numa will force a resize, destroying the ptr array.
''' ~ Do not address the array outside its allocated size.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This is a simple interface for gathering statistics
''' from a numa, where a histogram is used 'under the covers'
''' to avoid sorting if a rank value is requested.  In that case,
''' by using a histogram we are trading speed for accuracy, because
''' the values in %na are quantized to the center of a set of bins.
''' (2) If the median, other rank value, or histogram are not requested,
''' the calculation is all performed on the input Numa.
''' (3) The variance is the average of the square of the
''' difference from the mean.  The median is the value in na
''' with rank 0.5.
''' (4) There are two situations where this gives rank results with
''' accuracy comparable to computing stastics directly on the input
''' data, without binning into a histogram:
''' (a) the data is integers and the range of data is less than
''' %maxbins, and
''' (b) the data is floats and the range is small compared to
''' %maxbins, so that the binsize is much less than 1.
''' (5) If a histogram is used and the numbers in the Numa extend
''' over a large range, you can limit the required storage by
''' specifying the maximum number of bins in the histogram.
''' Use %maxbins == 0 to force the bin size to be 1.
''' (6) This optionally returns the median and one arbitrary rank value.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This function is intended to be used on a distribution of
''' values that represent two sets, such as a histogram of
''' pixel values for an image with a fg and bg, and the goal
''' is to determine the averages of the two sets and the
''' best splitting point.
''' (2) The Otsu method finds a split point that divides the distribution
''' into two parts by maximizing a score function that is the
''' product of two terms:
''' (a) the square of the difference of centroids, (ave1 - ave2)^2
''' (b) fract1  (1 - fract1)
''' where fract1 is the fraction in the lower distribution.
''' (3) This works well for images where the fg and bg are
''' each relatively homogeneous and well-separated in color.
''' However, if the actual fg and bg sets are very different
''' in size, and the bg is highly varied, as can occur in some
''' scanned document images, this will bias the split point
''' into the larger "bump" (i.e., toward the point where the
''' (b) term reaches its maximum of 0.25 at fract1 = 0.5.
''' To avoid this, we define a range of values near the
''' maximum of the score function, and choose the value within
''' this range such that the histogram itself has a minimum value.
''' The range is determined by scorefract: we include all abscissa
''' values to the left and right of the value that maximizes the
''' score, such that the score stays above (1 - scorefract)  maxscore.
''' The intuition behind this modification is to try to find
''' a split point that both has a high variance score and is
''' at or near a minimum in the histogram, so that the histogram
''' slope is small at the split point.
''' (4) We normalize the score so that if the two distributions

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) The %naa has two or more 256-element numa histograms, which
''' are to be compared value-wise at each of the 256 gray levels.
''' The result are stats (mean, mean square, variance, root variance)
''' aggregated across the set of histograms, and each is output
''' as a 256 entry numa.  Think of these histograms as a matrix,
''' where each histogram is one row of the array.  The stats are
''' then aggregated column-wise, between the histograms.
''' (2) These stats are:
''' ~ average value:  smaller v bigger   (nam)
''' ~ average squared value:  smaller vv bigger  (nams)
''' ~ variance:  smaller (v -  smaller v bigger )(v -  smaller v bigger ) bigger  =  smaller vv bigger  -  smaller v bigger  smaller v bigger   (nav)
''' ~ square-root of variance: (narv)
''' where the brackets  smaller  ..  bigger  indicate that the average value is
''' to be taken over each column of the array.
''' (3) The input histograms are optionally smoothed before these
''' statistical operations.
''' (4) The input histograms are normalized to a sum of 10000.  By
''' doing this, the resulting numbers are independent of the
''' number of samples used in building the individual histograms.
''' (5) A typical application is on a set of histograms from tiles
''' of an image, to distinguish between text/tables and photo
''' regions.  If the tiles are much larger than the text line
''' spacing, text/table regions typically have smaller variance
''' across tiles than photo regions.  For this application, it
''' may be useful to ignore values near white, which are large for
''' text and would magnify the variance due to variations in
''' illumination.  However, because the variance of a drawing or
''' a light photo can be similar to that of grayscale text, this
''' function is only a discriminator between darker photos/drawings
''' and light photos/text/line-graphics.

''' Notes:
''' (1) This is a simple and elegant solution to a problem in
''' computational geometry that at first appears to be quite
''' difficult: what is the largest rectangle that can be
''' placed in the image, covering only pixels of one polarity
''' (bg or fg)?  The solution is O(n), where n is the number
''' of pixels in the image, and it requires nothing more than
''' using a simple recursion relation in a single sweep of the image.
''' (2) In a sweep from UL to LR with left-to-right being the fast
''' direction, calculate the largest white rectangle at (x, y),
''' using previously calculated values at pixels #1 and #2:
''' #1: (x, y - 1)
''' #2: (x - 1, y)
''' We also need the most recent "black" pixels that were seen
''' in the current row and column.
''' Consider the largest area.  There are only two possibilities:
''' (a)  Min(w(1), horizdist)  (h(1) + 1)
''' (b)  Min(h(2), vertdist)  (w(2) + 1)
''' where
''' horizdist: the distance from the rightmost "black" pixel seen
''' in the current row across to the current pixel
''' vertdist: the distance from the lowest "black" pixel seen
''' in the current column down to the current pixel
''' and we choose the Max of (a) and (b).
''' (3) To convince yourself that these recursion relations are correct,
''' it helps to draw the maximum rectangles at #1 and #2.
''' Then for #1, you try to extend the rectangle down one line,
''' so that the height is h(1) + 1.  Do you get the full
''' width of #1, w(1)?  It depends on where the black pixels are
''' in the current row.  You know the final width is bounded by w(1)
''' and w(2) + 1, but the actual value depends on the distribution
''' of black pixels in the current row that are at a distance
''' from the current pixel that is between these limits.
''' We call that value "horizdist", and the area is then given
''' by the expression (a) above.  Using similar reasoning for #2,
''' where you attempt to extend the rectangle to the right
''' by 1 pixel, you arrive at (b).  The largest rectangle is
''' then found by taking the Max.

''' Notes:
''' (1) This uses the elegant Breuel algorithm, found in "Two
''' Geometric Algorithms for Layout Analysis", 2002,
''' url: "citeseer.ist.psu.edu/breuel02two.html".
''' It starts with the bounding boxes (b.b.) of the connected
''' components (c.c.) in a region, along with the rectangle
''' representing that region.  It repeatedly divides the
''' rectangle into four maximal rectangles that exclude a
''' pivot rectangle, sorting them in a priority queue
''' according to one of the six sort flags.  It returns a boxa
''' of the "largest" set that have no intersection with boxes
''' from the input boxas.
''' (2) If box == NULL, the initial region is the minimal region
''' that includes the origin and every box in boxas.
''' (3) maxboxes is the maximum number of whitespace boxes that will
''' be returned.  The actual number will depend on the image
''' and the values chosen for maxoverlap and maxpops.  In many
''' cases, the actual number will be 'maxboxes'.
''' (4) maxoverlap allows pruning of whitespace boxes depending on
''' the overlap.  To avoid all pruning, use maxoverlap = 1.0.
''' To select only boxes that have no overlap with each other
''' (maximal pruning), choose maxoverlap = 0.0.
''' Otherwise, no box can have more than the 'maxoverlap' fraction
''' of its area overlapped by any larger (in the sense of the
''' sortflag) box.
''' (5) Choose maxperim (actually, maximum half-perimeter) to
''' represent a c.c. that is small enough so that you don't care
''' about the white space that could be inside of it.  For all such
''' c.c., the pivot for 'quadfurcation' of a rectangle is selected
''' as having a reasonable proximity to the rectangle centroid.
''' (6) Use fract in the range [0.0 ... 1.0].  Set fract = 0.0
''' to choose the small box nearest the centroid as the pivot.
''' If you choose fract  bigger  0.0, it is suggested that you call
''' boxaPermuteRandom() first, to permute the boxes (see usage below).
''' This should reduce the search time for each of the pivot boxes.
''' (7) Choose maxpops to be the maximum number of rectangles that
''' are popped from the heap.  This is an indirect way to limit the
''' execution time.  Use 0 for default (a fairly large number).
''' At any time, you can expect the heap to contain about
''' 2.5 times as many boxes as have been popped off.
''' (8) The output result is a sorted set of overlapping
''' boxes, constrained by 'maxboxes', 'maxoverlap' and 'maxpops'.
''' (9) The main defect of the method is that it abstracts out the
''' actual components, retaining only the b.b. for analysis.
''' Consider a component with a large b.b.  If this is chosen
''' as a pivot, all white space inside is immediately taken
''' out of consideration.  Furthermore, even if it is never chosen
''' as a pivot, as the partitioning continues, at no time will
''' any of the whitespace inside this component be part of a
''' rectangle with zero overlapping boxes.  Thus, the interiors
''' of all boxes are necessarily excluded from the union of
''' the returned whitespace boxes.
''' (10) It should be noted that the algorithm puts a large number
''' of partels on the queue.  Setting a limit of X partels to
''' remove from the queue, one typically finds that there will be
''' several times that number (say, 2X - 3X) left on the queue.
''' For an efficient algorithm to find the largest white or
''' or black rectangles, without permitting them to overlap,
''' see pixFindLargeRectangles().
''' (11) USAGE: One way to accommodate to this weakness is to remove such
''' large b.b. before starting the computation.  For example,
''' if 'box' is an input image region containing 'boxa' b.b. of c.c.:
''' // Faster pivot choosing
''' boxaPermuteRandom(boxa, boxa);
''' // Remove anything either large width or height
''' boxat = boxaSelectBySize(boxa, maxwidth, maxheight,
''' L_SELECT_IF_BOTH, L_SELECT_IF_LT,
''' NULL);
''' boxad = boxaGetWhiteblocks(boxat, box, type, maxboxes,
''' maxoverlap, maxperim, fract,
''' maxpops);
''' The result will be rectangular regions of "white space" that
''' extend into (and often through) the excluded components.
''' (11) As a simple example, suppose you wish to find the columns on a page.
''' First exclude large c.c. that may block the columns, and then call:
''' boxad = boxaGetWhiteblocks(boxa, box, L_SORT_BY_HEIGHT,
''' 20, 0.15, 200, 0.2, 2000);
''' to get the 20 tallest boxes with no more than 0.15 overlap
''' between a box and any of the taller ones, and avoiding the
''' use of any c.c. with a b.b. half perimeter greater than 200
''' as a pivot.

''' Notes:
''' (1) To wrap only one image in pdf, input %plpd = NULL, and
''' the value of %position will be ignored:
''' convertToPdf(...  type, quality, x, y, res, NULL, 0);
''' (2) To wrap multiple images on a single pdf page, this is called
''' once for each successive image.  Do it this way:
''' L_PDF_DATA   lpd;
''' convertToPdf(...  type, quality, x, y, res, lpd, L_FIRST_IMAGE);
''' convertToPdf(...  type, quality, x, y, res, lpd, L_NEXT_IMAGE);
''' ...
''' convertToPdf(...  type, quality, x, y, res, lpd, L_LAST_IMAGE);
''' This will write the result to the value of %fileout specified
''' in the first call; succeeding values of %fileout are ignored.
''' On the last call: the pdf data bytes are computed and written
''' to %fileout, lpd is destroyed internally, and the returned
''' value of lpd is null.  So the client has nothing to clean up.
''' (3) (a) Set %res == 0 to respect the resolution embedded in the
''' image file.  If no resolution is embedded, it will be set
''' to the default value.
''' (b) Set %res to some other value to override the file resolution.
''' (4) (a) If the input %res and the resolution of the output device
''' are equal, the image will be "displayed" at the same size
''' as the original.
''' (b) If the input %res is 72, the output device will render
''' the image at 1 pt/pixel.
''' (c) Some possible choices for the default input pix resolution are:
''' 72 ppi  Render pix on any output device at one pt/pixel
''' 96 ppi  Windows default for generated display images
''' 300 ppi  Typical default for scanned images.
''' We choose 300, which is sensible for rendering page images.
''' However,  images come from a variety of sources, and

''' Notes:
''' (1) If there are no image regions, set %boxa == NULL;
''' %quality and %scalefactor are ignored.
''' (2) Typically, %scalefactor is  smaller  1.0, because the image regions
''' can be rendered at a lower resolution (for better compression)
''' than the text regions.  If %scalefactor == 0, we use 1.0.
''' If the input image is 1 bpp and scalefactor  smaller  1.0, we

''' before compressing them.
''' (3) If the compression type for non-image regions is L_G4_ENCODE

' pixClone(PIX *) as PIX *
''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) A "clone" is simply a handle (ptr) to an existing pix.
''' It is implemented because (a) images can be large and
''' hence expensive to copy, and (b) extra handles to a data
''' structure need to be made with a simple policy to avoid
''' both double frees and memory leaks.  Pix are reference
''' counted.  The side effect of pixClone() is an increase
''' by 1 in the ref count.
''' (2) The protocol to be used is:
''' (a) Whenever you want a new handle to an existing image,
''' call pixClone(), which just bumps a ref count.
''' (b) Always call pixDestroy() on all handles.  This
''' decrements the ref count, nulls the handle, and

''' Notes:
''' (1) This does a complete data transfer from pixs to pixd,
''' followed by the destruction of pixs (refcount permitting).
''' (2) If the refcount of pixs is 1, pixs is destroyed.  Otherwise,
''' the data in pixs is copied (rather than transferred) to pixd.
''' (3) This operation, like all others with a pre-existing pixd,
''' will side-effect any existing clones of pixd.  The pixd
''' refcount does not change.
''' (4) When might you use this?  Suppose you have an in-place Pix
''' function (returning void) with the typical signature:
''' void function-inplace(PIX pix, ...)
''' where "..." are non-pointer input parameters, and suppose
''' further that you sometimes want to return an arbitrary Pix
''' in place of the input Pix.  There are two ways you can do this:
''' (a) The straightforward way is to change the function
''' signature to take the address of the Pix ptr:
''' \code
''' void function-inplace(PIX ppix, ...) {
''' PIX pixt = function-makenew(ppix);
''' pixDestroy(ppix);
''' ppix = pixt;
''' return;
''' }
''' \endcode
''' Here, the input and returned pix are different, as viewed
''' by the calling function, and the inplace function is
''' expected to destroy the input pix to avoid a memory leak.
''' (b) Keep the signature the same and use pixTransferAllData()
''' to return the new Pix in the input Pix struct:
''' \code
''' void function-inplace(PIX pix, ...) {
''' PIX pixt = function-makenew(pix);
''' pixTransferAllData(pix, pixt, 0, 0);
''' // pixDestroy() is called on pixt
''' return;
''' }
''' \endcode
''' Here, the input and returned pix are the same, as viewed
''' by the calling function, and the inplace function must
''' never destroy the input pix, because the calling function
''' maintains an unchanged handle to it.

' pixGetLinePtrs()
' pixGetLinePtrs(PIX *, l_int32 *) as void **
''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This is intended to be used for fast random pixel access.
''' For example, for an 8 bpp image,
''' val = GET_DATA_BYTE(lines8[i], j);
''' is equivalent to, but much faster than,
''' pixGetPixel(pix, j, i, val);
''' (2) How much faster?  For 1 bpp, it's from 6 to 10x faster.
''' For 8 bpp, it's an amazing 30x faster.  So if you are
''' doing random access over a substantial part of the image,
''' use this line ptr array.
''' (3) When random access is used in conjunction with a stack,
''' queue or heap, the overall computation time depends on
''' the operations performed on each struct that is popped
''' or pushed, and whether we are using a priority queue (O(logn))
''' or a queue or stack (O(1)).  For example, for maze search,
''' the overall ratio of time for line ptrs vs. pixGet/Set is
''' Maze type  Type    Time ratio
''' binary   queue   0.4
''' gray  heap (priority queue)  0.6
''' (4) Because this returns a void and the accessors take void,
''' the compiler cannot check the pointer types.  It is
''' strongly recommended that you adopt a naming scheme for
''' the returned ptr arrays that indicates the pixel depth.
''' (This follows the original intent of Simonyi's "Hungarian"
''' application notation, where naming is used proactively
''' to make errors visibly obvious.)  By doing this, you can
''' tell by inspection if the correct accessor is used.
''' For example, for an 8 bpp pixg:
''' void lineg8 = pixGetLinePtrs(pixg, NULL);
''' val = GET_DATA_BYTE(lineg8[i], j);  // fast access; BYTE, 8
''' ...
''' LEPT_FREE(lineg8);  // don't forget this
''' (5) These are convenient for accessing bytes sequentially in an
''' 8 bpp grayscale image.  People who write image processing code
''' on 8 bpp images are accustomed to grabbing pixels directly out
''' of the raster array.  Note that for little endians, you first
''' need to reverse the byte order in each 32-bit word.
''' Here's a typical usage pattern:
''' pixEndianByteSwap(pix);   // always safe; no-op on big-endians
''' l_uint8 lineptrs = (l_uint8 )pixGetLinePtrs(pix, NULL);
''' pixGetDimensions(pix, w, h, NULL);
''' for (i = 0; i  smaller  h; i++) {
''' l_uint8 line = lineptrs[i];
''' for (j = 0; j  smaller  w; j++) {
''' val = line[j];
''' ...
''' }
''' }
''' pixEndianByteSwap(pix);  // restore big-endian order
''' LEPT_FREE(lineptrs);
''' This can be done even more simply as follows:
''' l_uint8 lineptrs = pixSetupByteProcessing(pix, w, h);
''' for (i = 0; i  smaller  h; i++) {
''' l_uint8 line = lineptrs[i];
''' for (j = 0; j  smaller  w; j++) {
''' val = line[j];
''' ...
''' }
''' }

''' In the second, the mask is used one pixel at a time to

''' Notes:
''' (1) In-place operation.  Calls pixSetMaskedCmap() for colormapped
''' images.
''' (2) For 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 bpp gray, we take the appropriate
''' number of least significant bits of val.
''' (3) If pixm == NULL, it's a no-op.
''' (4) The mask origin is placed at (x,y) on pixd, and the
''' operation is clipped to the intersection of rectangles.
''' (5) For rgb, the components in val are in the canonical locations,
''' with red in location COLOR_RED, etc.
''' (6) Implementation detail 1:
''' For painting with val == 0 or val == maxval, you can use rasterop.
''' If val == 0, invert the mask so that it's 0 over the region
''' into which you want to write, and use PIX_SRC  PIX_DST to
''' clear those pixels.  To write with val = maxval (all 1's),
''' use PIX_SRC | PIX_DST to set all bits under the mask.
''' (7) Implementation detail 2:
''' The rasterop trick can be used for depth  bigger  1 as well.
''' For val == 0, generate the mask for depth d from the binary
''' mask using
''' pixmd = pixUnpackBinary(pixm, d, 1);
''' and use pixRasterop() with PIX_MASK.  For val == maxval,
''' pixmd = pixUnpackBinary(pixm, d, 0);
''' and use pixRasterop() with PIX_PAINT.
''' But note that if d == 32 bpp, it is about 3x faster to use
''' the general implementation (not pixRasterop()).
''' (8) Implementation detail 3:
''' It might be expected that the switch in the inner loop will
''' cause large branching delays and should be avoided.
''' This is not the case, because the entrance is always the
''' same and the compiler can correctly predict the jump.

''' They determine the set of possible tiles that can be used

''' (6) %distblend is used for alpha blending.  It is only applied
''' if there is exactly one c.c. in the mask.  Use distblend == 0
''' to skip blending and just paint through the 1 bpp mask.
''' (7) To apply blending to more than 1 component, call this function
''' repeatedly with %pixm, %x and %y representing one component of
''' the mask each time.  This would be done as follows, for an

''' After selection, mirror replication is used to generate an

''' blending can also be used outside of the component, but near the
''' edge, to blur the transition between painted and original pixels.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This sets the r, g and b components under every fully
''' transparent alpha component to %val.  The alpha components
''' are unchanged.
''' (2) Full transparency is denoted by alpha == 0.  Setting
''' all pixels to a constant %val where alpha is transparent
''' can improve compressibility by reducing the entropy.
''' (3) The visual result depends on how the image is displayed.
''' (a) For display devices that respect the use of the alpha
''' layer, this will not affect the appearance.
''' (b) For typical leptonica operations, alpha is ignored,
''' so there will be a change in appearance because this
''' resets the rgb values in the fully transparent region.
''' (4) pixRead() and pixWrite() will, by default, read and write
''' 4-component (rgba) pix in png format.  To ignore the alpha
''' component after reading, or omit it on writing, pixSetSpp(..., 3).
''' (5) Here are some examples:
''' To convert all fully transparent pixels in a 4 component
''' (rgba) png file to white:
''' pixs = pixRead( smaller infile bigger );
''' pixd = pixSetUnderTransparency(pixs, 0xffffff00, 0);
''' To write pixd with the alpha component:
''' pixWrite( smaller outfile bigger , pixd, IFF_PNG);
''' To write and rgba image without the alpha component, first do:
''' pixSetSpp(pixd, 3);
''' If you later want to use the alpha, spp must be reset to 4.
''' (fancier) To remove the alpha by blending the image over
''' a white background:
''' pixRemoveAlpha()
''' This changes all pixel values where the alpha component is
''' not opaque (255).
''' (6) Caution.  rgb images in leptonica typically have value 0 in
''' the alpha channel, which is fully transparent.  If spp for
''' such an image were changed from 3 to 4, the image becomes
''' fully transparent, and this function will set each pixel to %val.
''' If you really want to set every pixel to the same value,
''' use pixSetAllArbitrary().
''' (7) This is useful for compressing an RGBA image where the part
''' of the image that is fully transparent is random junk; compression
''' is typically improved by setting that region to a constant.
''' For rendering as a 3 component RGB image over a uniform
''' background of arbitrary color, use pixAlphaBlendUniform().

''' a. Fraction of fill into the bounding box
''' b. Max-min distance of fg pixel from periphery of bounding box
''' c. Max depth of bg intrusions into component within bounding box
''' The weakness of (a) is that it is highly sensitive to holes

''' (3) We can think of the conforming condition as follows:
''' No pixel inside a distance %dist from the boundary
''' can connect to the boundary through a path through the bg.
''' To implement this, we need to do a flood fill.  We can go

''' So we adopt (1), and clip the box first, if necessary,

''' The distances to the outer frame boundary are given by hf1

''' (2) Special cases:
''' full fg mask: hf1 = vf1 = 0.0, hf2 = vf2 = 1.0.
''' empty fg (zero width) mask: set  hf1 = hf2  and vf1 = vf2.
''' fg rectangle with no hole: set hf2 = vf2 = 1.0.
''' frame touching outer boundary: set hf1 = vf1 = 0.0.
''' (3) The vertical thickness of the horizontal mask parts

''' quantization:
''' (a) If the image is made orthographically and has not more
''' than 256 'colors' at the level 4 octcube leaves,
''' it is quantized nearly exactly.  The ditherflag
''' is ignored.
''' (b) Most natural images have more than 256 different colors;
''' in that case we use adaptive octree quantization,
''' with dithering if requested.
''' (2) If there are not more than 256 occupied level 4 octcubes,
''' the color in the colormap that represents all pixels in
''' one of those octcubes is given by the first pixel that
''' falls into that octcube.
''' (3) If there are more than 256 colors, we use adaptive octree
''' color quantization.
''' (4) Dithering gives better visual results on images where
''' there is a color wash (a slow variation of color), but it
''' is about twice as slow and results in significantly larger
''' files when losslessly compressed (e.g., into png).

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) If called from pixWriteStream(), the stream is positioned
''' at the beginning of the file.
''' (2) To do sequential writes of png format images to a stream,
''' use pixWriteStreamPng() directly.
''' (3) gamma is an optional png chunk.  If no gamma value is to be
''' placed into the file, use gamma = 0.0.  Otherwise, if
''' gamma  bigger  0.0, its value is written into the header.
''' (4) The use of gamma in png is highly problematic.  For an illuminating
''' discussion, see:  http://hsivonen.iki.fi/png-gamma/
''' (5) What is the effect/meaning of gamma in the png file?  This
''' gamma, which we can call the 'source' gamma, is the
''' inverse of the gamma that was used in enhance.c to brighten
''' or darken images.  The 'source' gamma is supposed to indicate
''' the intensity mapping that was done at the time the
''' image was captured.  Display programs typically apply a
''' 'display' gamma of 2.2 to the output, which is intended
''' to linearize the intensity based on the response of
''' thermionic tubes (CRTs).  Flat panel LCDs have typically
''' been designed to give a similar response as CRTs (call it
''' "backward compatibility").  The 'display' gamma is
''' in some sense the inverse of the 'source' gamma.
''' jpeg encoders attached to scanners and cameras will lighten
''' the pixels, applying a gamma corresponding to approximately
''' a square-root relation of output vs input:
''' output = input^(gamma)
''' where gamma is often set near 0.4545  (1/gamma is 2.2).
''' This is stored in the image file.  Then if the display
''' program reads the gamma, it will apply a display gamma,
''' typically about 2.2; the product is 1.0, and the
''' display program produces a linear output.  This works because
''' the dark colors were appropriately boosted by the scanner,
''' as described by the 'source' gamma, so they should not
''' be further boosted by the display program.
''' (6) As an example, with xv and display, if no gamma is stored,
''' the program acts as if gamma were 0.4545, multiplies this by 2.2,
''' and does a linear rendering.  Taking this as a baseline
''' brightness, if the stored gamma is:
'''  bigger  0.4545, the image is rendered lighter than baseline
'''  smaller  0.4545, the image is rendered darker than baseline
''' In contrast, gqview seems to ignore the gamma chunk in png.
''' (7) The only valid pixel depths in leptonica are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
''' and 32.  However, it is possible, and in some cases desirable,
''' to write out a png file using an rgb pix that has 24 bpp.
''' For example, the open source xpdf SplashBitmap class generates
''' 24 bpp rgb images.  Consequently, we enable writing 24 bpp pix.
''' To generate such a pix, you can make a 24 bpp pix without data
''' and assign the data array to the pix; e.g.,
''' pix = pixCreateHeader(w, h, 24);
''' pixSetData(pix, rgbdata);
''' See pixConvert32To24() for an example, where we get rgbdata
''' from the 32 bpp pix.  Caution: do not call pixSetPadBits(),
''' because the alignment is wrong and you may erase part of the
''' last pixel on each line.
''' (8) If the pix has a colormap, it is written to file.  In most
''' situations, the alpha component is 255 for each colormap entry,
''' which is opaque and indicates that it should be ignored.
''' However, if any alpha component is not 255, it is assumed that
''' the alpha values are valid, and they are written to the png
''' file in a tRNS segment.  On readback, the tRNS segment is
''' identified, and the colormapped image with alpha is converted
''' to a 4 spp rgba image.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) The alpha channel is transformed separately from pixs,
''' and aligns with it, being fully transparent outside the
''' boundary of the transformed pixs.  For pixels that are fully
''' transparent, a blending function like pixBlendWithGrayMask()
''' will give zero weight to corresponding pixels in pixs.
''' (2) If pixg is NULL, it is generated as an alpha layer that is
''' partially opaque, using %fract.  Otherwise, it is cropped
''' to pixs if required and %fract is ignored.  The alpha channel
''' in pixs is never used.
''' (3) Colormaps are removed.
''' (4) When pixs is transformed, it doesn't matter what color is brought
''' in because the alpha channel will be transparent (0) there.
''' (5) To avoid losing source pixels in the destination, it may be
''' necessary to add a border to the source pix before doing
''' the projective transformation.  This can be any non-negative
''' number.
''' (6) The input %ptad and %ptas are in a coordinate space before
''' the border is added.  Internally, we compensate for this
''' before doing the projective transform on the image after
''' the border is added.
''' (7) The default setting for the border values in the alpha channel
''' is 0 (transparent) for the outermost ring of pixels and
''' (0.5  fract  255) for the second ring.  When blended over
''' a second image, this
''' (a) shrinks the visible image to make a clean overlap edge
''' with an image below, and
''' (b) softens the edges by weakening the aliasing there.
''' Use l_setAlphaMaskBorder() to change these values.

''' (5) Display vs printed resolution:
''' If your display is 75 ppi and your image was created
''' at a resolution of 300 ppi, you can get the image
''' to print at the same size as it appears on your display
''' by either setting scale = 4.0 or by setting  res = 75.
''' Both tell the printer to make a 4x enlarged image.
''' If your image is generated at 150 ppi and you use scale = 1,
''' it will be rendered such that 150 pixels correspond
''' to 72 pts (1 inch on the printer).  This function does
''' the conversion from pixels (with or without scaling) to
''' pts, which are the units that the printer uses.
''' The printer will choose its own resolution to use
''' in rendering the image, which will not affect the size
''' of the rendered image.  That is because the output
''' PostScript file describes the geometry in terms of pts,
''' which are defined to be 1/72 inch.  The printer will
''' only see the size of the image in pts, through the
''' scale and translate parameters and the affine
''' transform (the ImageMatrix) of the image.
''' (6) To render multiple images on the same page, set
''' endpage = FALSE for each image until you get to the
''' last, for which you set endpage = TRUE.  This causes the
''' "showpage" command to be invoked.  Showpage outputs
''' the entire page and clears the raster buffer for the
''' next page to be added.  Without a "showpage",
''' subsequent images from the next page will overlay those
''' previously put down.
''' (7) For multiple pages, increment the page number, starting
''' with page 1.  This allows PostScript (and PDF) to build

''' Notes:
''' (1) See the usage comments in convertJpegToPS(), some of
''' which are repeated here.
''' (2) This is a wrapper for tiff g4.  The PostScript that
''' is generated is expanded by about 5/4 (due to the
''' ascii85 encoding.  If you convert to pdf (ps2pdf), the
''' ascii85 decoder is automatically invoked, so that the
''' pdf wrapped g4 file is essentially the same size as
''' the original g4 file.  It's useful to have the PS
''' file ascii85 encoded, because many printers will not
''' print binary PS files.
''' (3) For the first image written to a file, use "w", which
''' opens for write and clears the file.  For all subsequent
''' images written to that file, use "a".
''' (4) To render multiple images on the same page, set
''' endpage = FALSE for each image until you get to the
''' last, for which you set endpage = TRUE.  This causes the
''' "showpage" command to be invoked.  Showpage outputs
''' the entire page and clears the raster buffer for the
''' next page to be added.  Without a "showpage",
''' subsequent images from the next page will overlay those
''' previously put down.
''' (5) For multiple images to the same page, where you are writing
''' both jpeg and tiff-g4, you have two options:
''' (a) write the g4 first, as either image (maskflag == FALSE)
''' or imagemask (maskflag == TRUE), and then write the
''' jpeg over it.
''' (b) write the jpeg first and as the last item, write
''' the g4 as an imagemask (maskflag == TRUE), to paint
''' through the foreground only.
''' We have this flexibility with the tiff-g4 because it is 1 bpp.
''' (6) For multiple pages, increment the page number, starting
''' with page 1.  This allows PostScript (and PDF) to build

''' Notes:
''' (1) This checks first to see if the location is valid, and

''' it is simply inserted into that location.
''' (2) If there is an item at the insert location, items must be
''' moved down to make room for the insert.  In the downward
''' shift there are three options, given by %shiftflag.
''' ~ If %shiftflag == L_AUTO_DOWNSHIFT, a decision is made
''' whether, in a cascade of items, to downshift a minimum
''' amount or for all items above %index.  The decision is
''' based on the expectation of finding holes (null ptrs)
''' between %index and the bottom of the array.
''' Assuming the holes are distributed uniformly, if 2 or more
''' holes are expected, we do a minimum shift.
''' ~ If %shiftflag == L_MIN_DOWNSHIFT, the downward shifting
''' cascade of items progresses a minimum amount, until
''' the first empty slot is reached.  This mode requires
''' some computation before the actual shifting is done.
''' ~ If %shiftflag == L_FULL_DOWNSHIFT, a shifting cascade is
''' performed where pa[i] -- bigger  pa[i + 1] for all i  bigger = index.
''' Then, the item is inserted at pa[index].
''' (3) If you are not using L_AUTO_DOWNSHIFT, the rule of thumb is
''' to use L_FULL_DOWNSHIFT if the array is compacted (each
''' element points to an item), and to use L_MIN_DOWNSHIFT
''' if there are a significant number of null pointers.
''' There is no penalty to using L_MIN_DOWNSHIFT for a
''' compacted array, however, because the full shift is required
''' and we don't do the O(n) computation to look for holes.
''' (4) This should not be used repeatedly on large arrays,
''' because the function is generally O(n).
''' (5) However, it can be used repeatedly if we start with an empty
''' ptr array and insert only once at each location.  For example,
''' you can support an array of Numa, where at each ptr location
''' you store either 0 or 1 Numa, and the Numa can be added
''' randomly to the ptr array.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) Removing outliers is particularly important when recognition
''' goes against all the samples in the training set, as opposed
''' to the averages for each class.  The reason is that we get
''' an identification error if a mislabeled template is a best
''' match for an input sample.
''' (2) Because the score values depend strongly on the quality
''' of the character images, to avoid losing too many samples
''' we supplement a minimum score for retention with a score
''' necessary to acquire the minimum target number of templates.
''' To do this we are willing to use a lower threshold,
''' LOWER_SCORE_THRESHOLD, on the score.  Consequently, with
''' poor quality templates, we may keep samples with a score
''' less than %minscore, but never less than LOWER_SCORE_THRESHOLD.
''' And if the number of samples is less than %minsize, we do
''' not use any.
''' (3) This is meant to be used on a BAR, where the templates all
''' come from the same book; use minscore ~0.75.
''' (4) Method: make a scaled recog from the input %pixas.  Then,
''' for each class: generate the averages, match each
''' scaled template against the average, and save unscaled
''' templates that had a sufficiently good match.

''' Notes:
''' (1) Removing outliers is particularly important when recognition
''' goes against all the samples in the training set, as opposed

''' match for an input sample.
''' (2) This method compares each template against the average templates
''' of each class, and discards any template that has a higher
''' correlation to a class different from its own.  It also
''' sets a lower bound on correlation scores with its class average.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This has the standard set of 9 args for rasterop.
''' This function is your friend; it is worth memorizing!
''' (2) If the operation involves only dest, this calls
''' rasteropUniLow().  Otherwise, checks depth of the
''' src and dest, and if they match, calls rasteropLow().
''' (3) For the two-image operation, where both pixs and pixd
''' are defined, they are typically different images.  However
''' there are cases, such as pixSetMirroredBorder(), where
''' in-place operations can be done, blitting pixels from
''' one part of pixd to another.  Consequently, we permit
''' such operations.  If you use them, be sure that there
''' is no overlap between the source and destination rectangles
''' in pixd (!)
''' Background:
''' -----------
''' There are 18 operations, described by the op codes in pix.h.
''' One, PIX_DST, is a no-op.
''' Three, PIX_CLR, PIX_SET, and PIX_NOT(PIX_DST) operate only on the dest.
''' These are handled by the low-level rasteropUniLow().
''' The other 14 involve the both the src and the dest, and depend on
''' the bit values of either just the src or the bit values of both
''' src and dest.  They are handled by rasteropLow():
''' PIX_SRC  s
''' PIX_NOT(PIX_SRC)    ~s
''' PIX_SRC | PIX_DST    s | d
''' PIX_SRC  PIX_DST    s  d
''' PIX_SRC ^ PIX_DST    s ^ d
''' PIX_NOT(PIX_SRC) | PIX_DST   ~s | d
''' PIX_NOT(PIX_SRC)  PIX_DST   ~s  d
''' PIX_NOT(PIX_SRC) ^ PIX_DST   ~s ^ d
''' PIX_SRC | PIX_NOT(PIX_DST) s | ~d
''' PIX_SRC  PIX_NOT(PIX_DST) s  ~d
''' PIX_SRC ^ PIX_NOT(PIX_DST) s ^ ~d
''' PIX_NOT(PIX_SRC | PIX_DST)   ~(s | d)
''' PIX_NOT(PIX_SRC  PIX_DST)   ~(s  d)
''' PIX_NOT(PIX_SRC ^ PIX_DST)   ~(s ^ d)
''' Each of these is implemented with one of three low-level
''' functions, depending on the alignment of the left edge
''' of the src and dest rectangles:
''' a fastest implementation if both left edges are
''' (32-bit) word aligned
''' a very slightly slower implementation if both left
''' edges have the same relative (32-bit) word alignment
''' the general routine that is invoked when
''' both left edges have different word alignment
''' Of the 14 binary rasterops above, only 12 are unique
''' logical combinations (out of a possible 16) of src
''' and dst bits:
''' (sd)   (11)   (10)   (01)   (00)
''' -----------------------------------------------
''' s   1   1   0   0
''' ~s   0   1   0   1
''' s | d 1   1   1   0
''' s  d 1   0   0   0
''' s ^ d 0   1   1   0
''' ~s | d 1   0   1   1
''' ~s  d 0   0   1   0
''' ~s ^ d 1   0   0   1
''' s | ~d   1   1   0   1
''' s  ~d   0   1   0   0
''' s ^ ~d   1   0   0   1
''' ~(s | d)  0   0   0   1
''' ~(s  d)  0   1   1   1
''' ~(s ^ d)  1   0   0   1
''' Note that the following three operations are equivalent:
''' ~(s ^ d)
''' ~s ^ d
''' s ^ ~d
''' and in the implementation, we call them out with the first form;
''' namely, ~(s ^ d).
''' Of the 16 possible binary combinations of src and dest bits,
''' the remaining 4 unique ones are independent of the src bit.
''' They depend on either just the dest bit or on neither
''' the src nor dest bits:
''' d   1   0   1   0 (indep. of s)
''' ~d   0   1   0   1 (indep. of s)
''' CLR  0   0   0   0 (indep. of both s  d)
''' SET  1   1   1   1 (indep. of both s  d)
''' As mentioned above, three of these are implemented by
''' rasteropUniLow(), and one is a no-op.
''' How can these operation codes be represented by bits
''' in such a way that when the basic operations are performed
''' on the bits the results are unique for unique
''' operations, and mimic the logic table given above?
''' The answer is to choose a particular order of the pairings:
''' (sd)   (11)   (10)   (01)   (00)
''' (which happens to be the same as in the above table)
''' and to translate the result into 4-bit representations
''' of s and d.  For example, the Sun rasterop choice
''' (omitting the extra bit for clipping) is
''' PIX_SRC   0xc
''' PIX_DST   0xa
''' This corresponds to our pairing order given above:
''' (sd)   (11)   (10)   (01)   (00)
''' where for s = 1 we get the bit pattern
''' PIX_SRC:  1   1   0   0  (0xc)
''' and for d = 1 we get the pattern
''' PIX_DST:   1   0   1   0 (0xa)
''' OK, that's the pairing order that Sun chose.  How many different
''' ways can we assign bit patterns to PIX_SRC and PIX_DST to get
''' the boolean ops to work out?  Any of the 4 pairs can be put
''' in the first position, any of the remaining 3 pairs can go
''' in the second; and one of the remaining 2 pairs can go the the third.
''' There is a total of 432 = 24 ways these pairs can be permuted.

''' Notes:
''' (1) The alpha channel is transformed separately from pixs,
''' and aligns with it, being fully transparent outside the
''' boundary of the transformed pixs.  For pixels that are fully
''' transparent, a blending function like pixBlendWithGrayMask()
''' will give zero weight to corresponding pixels in pixs.
''' (2) Rotation is about the center of the image; for very small
''' rotations, just return a clone.  The dest is automatically
''' expanded so that no image pixels are lost.
''' (3) Rotation is by area mapping.  It doesn't matter what
''' color is brought in because the alpha channel will
''' be transparent (black) there.
''' (4) If pixg is NULL, it is generated as an alpha layer that is
''' partially opaque, using %fract.  Otherwise, it is cropped
''' to pixs if required and %fract is ignored.  The alpha
''' channel in pixs is never used.
''' (4) Colormaps are removed to 32 bpp.
''' (5) The default setting for the border values in the alpha channel
''' is 0 (transparent) for the outermost ring of pixels and
''' (0.5  fract  255) for the second ring.  When blended over
''' a second image, this
''' (a) shrinks the visible image to make a clean overlap edge
''' with an image below, and
''' (b) softens the edges by weakening the aliasing there.
''' Use l_setAlphaMaskBorder() to change these values.
''' (6) A subtle use of gamma correction is to remove gamma correction
''' before rotation and restore it afterwards.  This is done
''' by sandwiching this function between a gamma/inverse-gamma
''' photometric transform:
''' pixt = pixGammaTRCWithAlpha(NULL, pixs, 1.0 / gamma, 0, 255);
''' pixd = pixRotateWithAlpha(pixt, angle, NULL, fract);
''' pixGammaTRCWithAlpha(pixd, pixd, gamma, 0, 255);

' rotateAMColorFastLow() This is a special simplification of area mapping with division of each pixel into 16 sub-pixels.  The exact coefficients that should be used are the same as for the 4x linear interpolation scaling case, and are given there.  I tried to approximate these as weighted coefficients with a maximum sum of 4, which allows us to do the arithmetic in parallel for the R, G and B components in a 32 bit pixel.  However, there are three reasons for not doing that: (1) the loss of accuracy in the parallel implementation is visually significant (2) the parallel implementation (described below) is slower (3) the parallel implementation requires allocation of a temporary color image There are 16 cases for the choice of the subpixel, and for each, the mapping to the relevant source pixels is as follows: subpixel      src pixel weights --------      ----------------- 0          sp1 1          (3  sp1 + sp2) / 4 2          (sp1 + sp2) / 2 3          (sp1 + 3  sp2) / 4 4          (3  sp1 + sp3) / 4 5          (9  sp1 + 3  sp2 + 3  sp3 + sp4) / 16 6          (3  sp1 + 3  sp2 + sp3 + sp4) / 8 7          (3  sp1 + 9  sp2 + sp3 + 3  sp4) / 16 8          (sp1 + sp3) / 2 9          (3  sp1 + sp2 + 3  sp3 + sp4) / 8 10         (sp1 + sp2 + sp3 + sp4) / 4 11         (sp1 + 3  sp2 + sp3 + 3  sp4) / 8 12         (sp1 + 3  sp3) / 4 13         (3  sp1 + sp2 + 9  sp3 + 3  sp4) / 16 14         (sp1 + sp2 + 3  sp3 + 3  sp4) / 8 15         (sp1 + 3  sp2 + 3  sp3 + 9  sp4) / 16 Another way to visualize this is to consider the area mapping (or linear interpolation) coefficients  for the pixel sp1. Expressed in fourths, they can be written as asymmetric matrix: 4      3      2      1 3      2.25   1.5    0.75 2      1.5    1      0.5 1      0.75   0.5    0.25 The coefficients for the three neighboring pixels can be similarly written. This is implemented here, where, for each color component, we inline its extraction from each participating word, construct the linear combination, and combine the results into the destination 32 bit RGB pixel, using the appropriate shifts. It is interesting to note that an alternative method, where we do the arithmetic on the 32 bit pixels directly (after shifting the components so they won't overflow into each other) is significantly inferior.  Because we have only 8 bits for internal overflows, which can be distributed as 2, 3, 3, it is impossible to add these with the correct linear interpolation coefficients, which require a sum of up to 16. Rounding off to a sum of 4 causes appreciable visual artifacts in the rotated image.  The code for the inferior method can be found in prog/rotatefastalt.c, for reference.

The individual words in the input sarray are concatenated into textlines.  An input word string of zero length is taken to be a paragraph separator.  Each time such a string is found, the current line is ended and a new line is also produced that contains just the string of zero length "".  When the output sarray of lines is eventually converted to a string with newlines typically appended to each line string, the empty strings are just converted to newlines, producing the visible paragraph separation. What happens when a word is larger than linesize? We write it out as a single line anyway!  Words preceding or following this long word are placed on lines preceding or following the line with the long word.  Why this choice? Long "words" found in text documents are typically URLs, and it's often desirable not to put newlines in the middle of a URL. The text display program e.g., text editor will typically wrap the long "word" to fit in the window.</returns>

''' <returns>pixd, or NULL on error This function scales 32 bpp RGB; 2, 4 or 8 bpp palette color; 2, 4, 8 or 16 bpp gray; and binary images. When the input has palette color, the colormap is removed and the result is either 8 bpp gray or 32 bpp RGB, depending on whether the colormap has color entries.  Images with 2, 4 or 16 bpp are converted to 8 bpp. Because pixScale is meant to be a very simple interface to a number of scaling functions, including the use of unsharp masking, the type of scaling and the sharpening parameters are chosen by default.  Grayscale and color images are scaled using one of four methods, depending on the scale factors: 1 antialiased subsampling (lowpass filtering followed by subsampling, implemented here by area mapping), for scale factors less than 0.2 2 antialiased subsampling with sharpening, for scale factors between 0.2 and 0.7 3 linear interpolation with sharpening, for scale factors between 0.7 and 1.4 4 linear interpolation without sharpening, for scale factors >= 1.4. One could use subsampling for scale factors very close to 1.0, because it preserves sharp edges.  Linear interpolation blurs edges because the dest pixels will typically straddle two src edge pixels.  Subsmpling removes entire columns and rows, so the edge is not blurred.  However, there are two reasons for not doing this. First, it moves edges, so that a straight line at a large angle to both horizontal and vertical will have noticeable kinks where horizontal and vertical rasters are removed.  Second, although it is very fast, you get good results on sharp edges by applying a sharpening filter. For images with sharp edges, sharpening substantially improves the image quality for scale factors between about 0.2 and about 2.0. pixScale uses a small amount of sharpening by default because it strengthens edge pixels that are weak due to anti-aliasing. The default sharpening factors are: for scaling factors < 0.7:   sharpfract = 0.2    sharpwidth = 1 for scaling factors >= 0.7:  sharpfract = 0.4    sharpwidth = 2 The cases where the sharpening halfwidth is 1 or 2 have special implementations and are about twice as fast as the general case. However, sharpening is computationally expensive, and one needs to consider the speed-quality tradeoff: For upscaling of RGB images, linear interpolation plus default sharpening is about 5 times slower than upscaling alone. For downscaling, area mapping plus default sharpening is about 10 times slower than downscaling alone. When the scale factor is larger than 1.4, the cost of sharpening, which is proportional to image area, is very large compared to the incremental quality improvement, so we cut off the default use of sharpening at 1.4.  Thus, for scale factors greater than 1.4, pixScale only does linear interpolation. In many situations you will get a satisfactory result by scaling without sharpening: call pixScaleGeneral with %sharpfract = 0.0. Alternatively, if you wish to sharpen but not use the default value, first call pixScaleGeneral with %sharpfract = 0.0, and then sharpen explicitly using pixUnsharpMasking. Binary images are scaled to binary by sampling the closest pixel, without any low-pass filtering averaging of neighboring pixels. This will introduce aliasing for reductions.  Aliasing can be prevented by using pixScaleToGray instead.</returns>

''' <returns>pixd, or NULL on error This function is appropriate for upscaling magnification, where the scale factor is > 1, as well as for a small amount of downscaling reduction, with scale factor > 0.7.  If the scale factor is < 0.7, the best result is obtained by area mapping, but this is relatiely expensive.  A less expensive alternative with scale factor < 0.7 is low-pass filtering followed by subsampling (pixScaleSmooth()), which is effectively a cheap form of area mapping. Some more details follow. For each pixel in the dest, this does a linear interpolation of 4 neighboring pixels in the src. Specifically, consider the UL corner of src and dest pixels.  The UL corner of the dest falls within a src pixel, whose four corners are the UL corners of 4 adjacent src pixels.  The value of the dest is taken by linear interpolation using the values of the four src pixels and the distance of the UL corner of the dest from each corner. If the image is expanded so that the dest pixel is smaller than the src pixel, such interpolation is a reasonable approach.  This interpolation is also good for a small image reduction factor that is not more than a 2x reduction. Note that the linear interpolation algorithm for scaling is identical in form to the area-mapping algorithm for grayscale rotation.  The latter corresponds to a translation of each pixel without scaling. This function is NOT optimal if the scaling involves a large reduction.    If the image is significantly reduced, so that the dest pixel is much larger than the src pixels, this interpolation, which is over src pixels only near the UL corner of the dest pixel, is not going to give a good area-mapping average. Because area mapping for image scaling is considerably more computationally intensive than linear interpolation, we choose not to use it.   For large image reduction, linear interpolation over adjacent src pixels degenerates asymptotically to subsampling.  But subsampling without a low-pass pre-filter causes aliasing by the nyquist theorem.  To avoid aliasing, a low-pass filter e.g., an averaging filter of size roughly equal to the dest pixel i.e., the reduction factor should be applied to the src before subsampling. As an alternative to low-pass filtering and subsampling for large reduction factors, linear interpolation can also be done between the widely separated src pixels in which the corners of the dest pixel lie.  This also is not optimal, as it samples src pixels only near the corners of the dest pixel, and it is not implemented. The speed on circa 2005 Intel hardware for the general case (not 2x) is about 13  10^6 dest-pixels/sec/GHz.  The special 2x case runs at about 100  10^6 dest-pixels/sec/GHz.</returns>

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' For faster scaling in the range of scalefactors from 0.0625 to 0.5,
''' with very little difference in quality, use pixScaleToGrayFast().
''' Binary images have sharp edges, so they intrinsically have very
''' high frequency content.  To avoid aliasing, they must be low-pass
''' filtered, which tends to blur the edges.  How can we keep relatively
''' crisp edges without aliasing?  The trick is to do binary upscaling
''' followed by a power-of-2 scaleToGray.  For large reductions, where
''' you don't end up with much detail, some corners can be cut.
''' The intent here is to get high quality reduced grayscale
''' images with relatively little computation.  We do binary
''' pre-scaling followed by scaleToGrayN() for best results,
''' esp. to avoid excess blur when the scale factor is near
''' an inverse power of 2.  Where a low-pass filter is required,
''' we use simple convolution kernels: either the hat filter for
''' linear interpolation or a flat filter for larger downscaling.
''' Other choices, such as a perfect bandpass filter with infinite extent
''' (the sinc) or various approximations to it (e.g., lanczos), are
''' unnecessarily expensive.
''' The choices made are as follows:
''' (1) Do binary upscaling before scaleToGrayN() for scalefactors  bigger  1/8
''' (2) Do binary downscaling before scaleToGray8() for scalefactors
''' between 1/16 and 1/8.
''' (3) Use scaleToGray16() before grayscale downscaling for
''' scalefactors less than 1/16
''' Another reasonable choice would be to start binary downscaling
''' for scalefactors below 1/4, rather than below 1/8 as we do here.
''' The general scaling rules, not all of which are used here, go as follows:
''' (1) For grayscale upscaling, use pixScaleGrayLI().  However,
''' note that edges will be visibly blurred for scalefactors
''' near (but above) 1.0.  Replication will avoid edge blur,
''' and should be considered for factors very near 1.0.
''' (2) For grayscale downscaling with a scale factor larger than
''' about 0.7, use pixScaleGrayLI().  For scalefactors near
''' (but below) 1.0, you tread between Scylla and Charybdis.
''' pixScaleGrayLI() again gives edge blurring, but
''' pixScaleBySampling() gives visible aliasing.
''' (3) For grayscale downscaling with a scale factor smaller than
''' about 0.7, use pixScaleSmooth()
''' (4) For binary input images, do as much scale to gray as possible
''' using the special integer functions (2, 3, 4, 8 and 16).
''' (5) It is better to upscale in binary, followed by scaleToGrayN()
''' than to do scaleToGrayN() followed by an upscale using either
''' LI or oversampling.
''' (6) It may be better to downscale in binary, followed by
''' scaleToGrayN() than to first use scaleToGrayN() followed by
''' downscaling.  For downscaling between 8x and 16x, this is
''' a reasonable option.
''' (7) For reductions greater than 16x, it's reasonable to use
''' scaleToGray16() followed by further grayscale downscaling.

''' Notes:
''' This function is here mainly for pedagogical reasons.
''' Mip-mapping is widely used in graphics for texture mapping, because
''' the texture changes smoothly with scale.  This is accomplished by
''' constructing a multiresolution pyramid and, for each pixel,
''' doing a linear interpolation between corresponding pixels in
''' the two planes of the pyramid that bracket the desired resolution.
''' The computation is very efficient, and is implemented in hardware
''' in high-end graphics cards.
''' We can use mip-mapping for scale-to-gray by using two scale-to-gray
''' reduced images (we don't need the entire pyramid) selected from
''' the set {2x, 4x, ... 16x}, and interpolating.  However, we get
''' severe aliasing, probably because we are subsampling from the
''' higher resolution image.  The method is very fast, but the result
''' is very poor.  In fact, the results don't look any better than

''' Notes:
''' (1) The alpha channel is transformed separately from pixs,
''' and aligns with it, being fully transparent outside the
''' boundary of the transformed pixs.  For pixels that are fully
''' transparent, a blending function like pixBlendWithGrayMask()
''' will give zero weight to corresponding pixels in pixs.
''' (2) Scaling is done with area mapping or linear interpolation,
''' depending on the scale factors.  Default sharpening is done.
''' (3) If pixg is NULL, it is generated as an alpha layer that is
''' partially opaque, using %fract.  Otherwise, it is cropped
''' to pixs if required, and %fract is ignored.  The alpha
''' channel in pixs is never used.
''' (4) Colormaps are removed to 32 bpp.
''' (5) The default setting for the border values in the alpha channel
''' is 0 (transparent) for the outermost ring of pixels and
''' (0.5  fract  255) for the second ring.  When blended over
''' a second image, this
''' (a) shrinks the visible image to make a clean overlap edge
''' with an image below, and
''' (b) softens the edges by weakening the aliasing there.
''' Use l_setAlphaMaskBorder() to change these values.
''' (6) A subtle use of gamma correction is to remove gamma correction
''' before scaling and restore it afterwards.  This is done
''' by sandwiching this function between a gamma/inverse-gamma
''' photometric transform:
''' pixt = pixGammaTRCWithAlpha(NULL, pixs, 1.0 / gamma, 0, 255);

' seedfillGrayLow() Notes: (1) The pixels are numbered as follows: 1  2  3 4  x  5 6  7  8 This low-level filling operation consists of two scans, raster and anti-raster, covering the entire seed image. This is followed by a breadth-first propagation operation to complete the fill. During the anti-raster scan, every pixel p whose current value could still be propagated after the anti-raster scan is put into the FIFO queue. The propagation step is a breadth-first fill to completion. Unlike the simple grayscale seedfill pixSeedfillGraySimple(), where at least two full raster/anti-raster iterations are required for completion and verification, the hybrid method uses only a single raster/anti-raster set of scans. (2) The filling action can be visualized from the following example. Suppose the mask, which clips the fill, is a sombrero-shaped surface, where the highest point is 200 and the low pixels around the rim are 30.  Beyond the rim, the mask goes up a bit. Suppose the seed, which is filled, consists of a single point of height 150, located below the max of the mask, with the rest 0.  Then in the raster scan, nothing happens until the high seed point is encountered, and then this value is propagated right and down, until it hits the side of the sombrero.   The seed can never exceed the mask, so it fills to the rim, going lower along the mask surface.  When it passes the rim, the seed continues to fill at the rim height to the edge of the seed image.  Then on the anti-raster scan, the seed fills flat inside the sombrero to the upper and left, and then out from the rim as before.  The final result has a seed that is flat outside the rim, and inside it fills the sombrero but only up to 150.  If the rim height varies, the filled seed outside the rim will be at the highest point on the rim, which is a saddle point on the rim. (3) Reference paper : L.

''' Notes:
''' (1) This computes the distance of each pixel from the nearest
''' background pixel.  All bg pixels therefore have a distance of 0,
''' and the fg pixel distances increase linearly from 1 at the
''' boundary.  It can also be used to compute the distance of
''' each pixel from the nearest fg pixel, by inverting the input
''' image before calling this function.  Then all fg pixels have
''' a distance 0 and the bg pixel distances increase linearly
''' from 1 at the boundary.
''' (2) The algorithm, described in Leptonica on the page on seed
''' filling and connected components, is due to Luc Vincent.
''' In brief, we generate an 8 or 16 bpp image, initialized
''' with the fg pixels of the input pix set to 1 and the
''' 1-boundary pixels (i.e., the boundary pixels of width 1 on
''' the four sides set as either:
''' L_BOUNDARY_BG: 0
''' L_BOUNDARY_FG:  max
''' where max = 0xff for 8 bpp and 0xffff for 16 bpp.
''' Then do raster/anti-raster sweeps over all pixels interior
''' to the 1-boundary, where the value of each new pixel is
''' taken to be 1 more than the minimum of the previously-seen
''' connected pixels (using either 4 or 8 connectivity).
''' Finally, set the 1-boundary pixels using the mirrored method;
''' this removes the max values there.
''' (3) Using L_BOUNDARY_BG clamps the distance to 0 at the
''' boundary.  Using L_BOUNDARY_FG allows the distance
''' at the image boundary to "float".
''' (4) For 4-connected, one could initialize only the left and top
''' 1-boundary pixels, and go all the way to the right
''' and bottom; then coming back reset left and top.  But we
''' instead use a method that works for both 4- and 8-connected.

' pixSeedspread(PIX *, l_int32) as PIX *
''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) The raster/anti-raster method for implementing this filling
''' operation was suggested by Ray Smith.
''' (2) This takes an arbitrary set of nonzero pixels in pixs, which
''' can be sparse, and spreads (extrapolates) the values to
''' fill all the pixels in pixd with the nonzero value it is
''' closest to in pixs.  This is similar (though not completely
''' equivalent) to doing a Voronoi tiling of the image, with a
''' tile surrounding each pixel that has a nonzero value.
''' All pixels within a tile are then closer to its "central"
''' pixel than to any others.  Then assign the value of the
''' "central" pixel to each pixel in the tile.
''' (3) This is implemented by computing a distance function in parallel
''' with the fill.  The distance function uses free boundary
''' conditions (assumed maxval outside), and it controls the
''' propagation of the pixels in pixd away from the nonzero
''' (seed) values.  This is done in 2 traversals (raster/antiraster).
''' In the raster direction, whenever the distance function
''' is nonzero, the spread pixel takes on the value of its
''' predecessor that has the minimum distance value.  In the
''' antiraster direction, whenever the distance function is nonzero
''' and its value is replaced by a smaller value, the spread
''' pixel takes the value of the predecessor with the minimum
''' distance value.
''' (4) At boundaries where a pixel is equidistant from two
''' nearest nonzero (seed) pixels, the decision of which value
''' to use is arbitrary (greedy in search for minimum distance).
''' This can give rise to strange-looking results, particularly
''' for 4-connectivity where the L1 distance is computed from
''' steps in N,S,E and W directions (no diagonals).

''' Notes:
''' (1) This gives the actual local minima and maxima.
''' A local minimum is a pixel whose surrounding pixels all

''' (2) The minima are found by starting with the erosion-and-equality

''' by a qualification step, where each c.c. in the resulting

''' located, and they are queried.  If all of those pixels
''' are larger than the value of that minimum, it is a true
''' minimum and its c.c. is saved; otherwise the c.c. is
''' rejected.  Note that if a bordering pixel has the
''' same value as the minimum, it must then have a
''' neighbor that is smaller, so the component is not a
''' true minimum.

''' Notes:
''' (1) The horizontal and vertical lines along which elements are
''' selected are roughly equally spaced.  The actual locations of
''' the hits and misses are the centers of respective run-lengths.
''' (2) No elements are selected that are less than 'distance' pixels away
''' from a boundary pixel of the same color.  This makes the
''' match much more robust to edge noise.  Valid inputs of
''' 'distance' are 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.  If distance is either 0 or
''' greater than 4, we reset it to the default value.
''' (3) The 4 numbers for adding rectangles of pixels outside the fg
''' can be use if the pattern is expected to be surrounded by bg
''' (white) pixels.  On the other hand, if the pattern may be near
''' other fg (black) components on some sides, use 0 for those sides.
''' (4) The pixels added to a side allow you to have miss elements there.
''' There is a constraint between distance, minlength, and
''' the added pixels for this to work.  We illustrate using the
''' default values.  If you add 5 pixels to the top, and use a
''' distance of 1, then you end up with a vertical run of at least
''' 4 bg pixels along the top edge of the image.  If you use a
''' minimum runlength of 3, each vertical line will always find
''' a miss near the center of its run.  However, if you use a
''' minimum runlength of 5, you will not get a miss on every vertical
''' line.  As another example, if you have 7 added pixels and a
''' distance of 2, you can use a runlength up to 5 to guarantee
''' that the miss element is recorded.  We give a warning if the
''' constraint does not guarantee a miss element outside the
''' image proper.
''' (5) The input pix, as extended by the extra pixels on selected sides,
''' can optionally be returned.  For debugging, call

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This finds the skew angle, doing first a sweep through a set
''' of equal angles, and then doing a binary search until convergence.
''' (2) There are two built-in constants that determine if the
''' returned confidence is nonzero:
''' ~ MIN_VALID_MAXSCORE (minimum allowed maxscore)
''' ~ MINSCORE_THRESHOLD_CONSTANT (determines minimum allowed
''' minscore, by multiplying by (height  width^2)
''' If either of these conditions is not satisfied, the returned
''' confidence value will be zero.  The maxscore is optionally
''' returned in this function to allow evaluation of the
''' resulting angle by a method that is independent of the
''' returned confidence value.
''' (3) The larger the confidence value, the greater the probability
''' that the proper alignment is given by the angle that maximizes
''' variance.  It should be compared to a threshold, which depends
''' on the application.  Values between 3.0 and 6.0 are common.
''' (4) By default, the shear is about the UL corner.

It is for tags that take an array of bytes for a value, a number of elements in the array, and a type that is either "char" or "l_uint8" probably either will work. Use NULL if there are no such tags. f VERY IMPORTANT: if there are any tags that require the extra size value, stored in nasizes, they must be written first!</returns>

''' (6) Important usage points:

''' Notes:
''' (1) To generate the warped image p(x',y'), set up the transforms
''' that are in getWarpTransform().  For each (x',y') in the
''' dest, the warp function computes the originating location
''' (x, y) in the src.  The differences (x - x') and (y - y')
''' are given as a sum of products of sinusoidal terms.  Each
''' term is multiplied by a maximum amplitude (in pixels), and the
''' angle is determined by a frequency and phase, and depends
''' on the (x', y') value of the dest.  Random numbers with
''' a variable input seed are used to allow the warping to be
''' unpredictable.  A linear interpolation is used to find
''' the value for the source at (x, y); this value is written
''' into the dest.

''' <summary>
''' Notes:
''' (1) This function splits out the red channel, mucks around with
''' it, then recombines with the unmolested cyan channel.
''' (2) By using a quadratically increasing shift of the red
''' pixels horizontally and away from the vertical centerline,
''' the image appears to bend quadratically out of the image
''' plane, symmetrically with respect to the vertical center
''' line.  A positive value of %zbend causes the plane to be
''' curved away from the viewer.  We use linearly interpolated
''' stretching to avoid the appearance of kinks in the curve.
''' (3) The parameters %zshiftt and %zshiftb tilt the image plane
''' about a horizontal line through the center, and at the
''' same time move that line either in toward the viewer or away.
''' This is implemented by a combination of horizontal shear
''' about the center line (for the tilt) and horizontal
''' translation (to move the entire plane in or out).
''' A positive value of %zshiftt moves the top of the plane
''' away from the viewer, and a positive value of %zshiftb
''' moves the bottom of the plane away.  We use linear interpolated
''' shear to avoid visible vertical steps in the tilted image.
''' (4) The image can be bent in the plane and about the vertical
''' centerline.  The centerline does not shift, and the
''' parameter %ybend gives the relative shift at left and right
''' edges, with a downward shift for positive values of %ybend.
''' (6) When writing out a steroscopic (red/cyan) image in jpeg,
''' first call pixSetChromaSampling(pix, 0) to get sufficient
''' resolution in the red channel.
''' (7) Typical values are:
''' zbend = 20
''' zshiftt = 15
''' zshiftb = -15
''' ybendt = 30
''' ybendb = 0
''' If the disparity z-values are too large, it is difficult for
''' the brain to register the two images.
''' (8) This function has been cleverly reimplemented by Jeff Breidenbach.
''' The original implementation used two 32 bpp rgb images,
''' and merged them at the end.  The result is somewhat faded,
''' and has a parameter "thresh" that controls the amount of
''' color in the result.  (The present implementation avoids these
''' two problems, skipping both the colorization and the alpha
''' blending at the end, and is about 3x faster)
''' The basic operations with 32 bpp are as follows:
''' // Immediate conversion to 32 bpp
''' Pix pixt1 = pixConvertTo32(pixs);
''' // Do vertical shear
''' Pix pixr = pixQuadraticVerticalShear(pixt1, L_WARP_TO_RIGHT,
''' ybendt, ybendb,
''' L_BRING_IN_WHITE);
''' // Colorize two versions, toward red and cyan
''' Pix pixc = pixCopy(NULL, pixr);
''' l_int32 thresh = 150;  // if higher, get less original color
''' pixColorGray(pixr, NULL, L_PAINT_DARK, thresh, 255, 0, 0);
''' pixColorGray(pixc, NULL, L_PAINT_DARK, thresh, 0, 255, 255);
''' // Shift the red pixels; e.g., by stretching
''' Pix pixrs = pixStretchHorizontal(pixr, L_WARP_TO_RIGHT,
''' L_QUADRATIC_WARP, zbend,
''' L_INTERPOLATED,
''' L_BRING_IN_WHITE);
''' // Blend the shifted red and unshifted cyan 50:50
''' Pix pixg = pixCreate(w, h, 8);
''' pixSetAllArbitrary(pixg, 128);
''' pixd = pixBlendWithGrayMask(pixrs, pixc, pixg, 0, 0);

''' Notes:
''' (1) Before calling this function for the first time, use
''' pixaCreate() to make the %pixa that will accumulate the pix.
''' This is passed in each time pixSaveTiled() is called.
''' (2) %scalefactor scales the input image.  After scaling and
''' possible depth conversion, the image is saved in the input
''' pixa, along with a box that specifies the location to
''' place it when tiled later.  Disable saving the pix by
''' setting %scalefactor == 0.0.
''' (3) %newrow and %space specify the location of the new pix
''' with respect to the last one(s) that were entered.
''' (4) %dp specifies the depth at which all pix are saved.  It can
''' be only 8 or 32 bpp.  Any colormap is removed.  This is only
''' used at the first invocation.
''' (5) This function uses two variables from call to call.
''' If they were static, the function would not be .so or thread
''' safe, and furthermore, there would be interference with two or
''' more pixa accumulating images at a time.  Consequently,
''' we use the first pix in the pixa to store and obtain both
''' the depth and the current position of the bottom (one pixel
''' below the lowest image raster line when laid out using
''' the boxa).  The bottom variable is stored in the input format
''' field, which is the only field available for storing an int.
